He started with stationery and stockings, but went on to build one of the world?s biggest furniturecompanies.And the way he did it has revolutionised how retailers operate.', 'There are two facets of modern life that we haveIkeato thank for: flat-pack furniture and ashop layoutthat gets you buying more of its products than you initially intended to. Both are principles that a number of othercompanieshave put to good use.', 'Ikeafirst brought out its now signature style of flat-pack furniture in the 1950s. Whether you love or loathe this concept, it was astroke of geniusand a effective way of making the masses value the brand. There are theobvious aspectsof cost efficiency and the practicality of shipping. But flat-pack furniture also has an important subconscious influence on consumers.', 'WhenIkeamade the switch away from selling furniture that was already assembled, it was most likely unaware of how it would influence its consumers. Yet scientists have since managed to pinpoint why consumers simply can?t get enough of building their own furniture. The simple act of touching products (and what better way to ensure touch based interaction than through assembling a piece of furniture) can increase youroverall perceived valueof the product. Couple this with the fact that the more effort a consumer has to put into building something the more they like it ? you have an undoubtedly winning formula.', 'Tests have shownthat the actual act of putting something together (even though there may be sweat, swearing and tears involved) so that it becomes a complete object generates a much more favourable perception of that object than it would purchasing it in a completed form. The phenomenon is known asthe Ikea effect.', 'This effect is further enhanced by the fact that touch itself isneurologically coupled with emotion.', 'This means that when we touch something the emotive part of our brain is activated so that we experience a close connection with the product. Touch creates feelings of ownership and increases the perceived value we have of items. Thus the happy assembler of the flat pack will, once finished, feel proud of their achievement and experiencing feelings of being closely connected to the item.', 'Round and round in circles', 'The layout of theIkeastores has also paved the way for a more creative way of thinking about how to guide shoppers. If you have ever visited one of its huge warehouse stores, you may have gone in thinking you were only buying a few items, to find yourself coming out of the store with a trolley full of things. This is because of its circular design and one way system.', 'This design means you often can?t see what is coming next and fear you?ll miss something you need if you don?t continue all the way along the path. There are potential escape points throughout the store, but that would mean that you will miss several of the sections and rarely consumers are prepared to take that risk.', 'Because you know it may be tricky to revisit a particular item later on, you are inclined to pick it up when you see it and put it in your big trolley. This ensures that the customer touches the product, which in turn againgenerates a psychological sense of ownership over itand decreases the likelihood that it will be put down en route to the tills.', 'The fact that you can?t see around the next corner also creates a subconscious sense of mystery,which draws the customer gradually further into the store. Environments perceived to be mysterious usually generate an overall stronger liking and so encourage shoppers to keep walking through the store. And the more you do this, the more likely you are to buy something ? especially all the smaller items on display such as candles, napkins and picture frames as they seem cheap compared to the larger more expensive items.', 'Ikea?s creative ability to tap into the unconsciousness of consumers is undoubtedly a big part of its success ? and also why it?s beencopiedby many othercompanies.Even thoughIngvar Kampradis no longer with us,Ikeahas inherited from him an ethos of thinking outside of the box to communicate with consumers.

Detel, which entered the feature phone market in 2016, claims to have sold around 600,000 devices across price points so far.Run by Yogesh Bhatia, who used to be a distributor of mobile phones,Detelis aiming to connect those who could not afford a phone but dream about owning a phone. ?With a vision of connecting the 400 million people, we took the initiative to bring such phones to the people who could not afford a phone?our first productDetelD1 hit the market in 2017 with the tagline- ?Lo Kar Lo Baat? for Rs 299 and it has seen a tremendous response,? Bhatia told Business Standard.However, this is not the first time that a company has come out with a mobile phone for dirt cheap. How can one forget the euphoria around Freedom 251, which was touted as the world?s cheapest smartphone in 2016? Many believed it was impossible to sell a smartphone for Rs 251 and the belief indeed turned out to be true as the company Ringing Bells failed to deliver the devices after getting orders for millions of phones through online bookings. The company only provided a few thousand devices to consumers.However, Bhatia feels that theFreedom 251was possibly the most-hyped product in recent years and it turned out to be a disappointment as the company failed to deliver its promise. ?We are here to change the perception?We are trying to bring communication services in the most cost-effective manner, with a clear target to address the untapped section, who still feels that owning a phone is a luxury,? he added.Asked if the company is able to make money by selling a phone for Rs 299, Bhatia said they are at a break-even situation for the product but the company makes reasonable margins on other products. The price range of otherDetelmobile phones is Rs 349 to Rs 899. The company recently tied up with BSNL for voice and data offers with its feature-phones.', 'As part of the deal, aDetelD1 mobile along with a BSNL connection can be bought for Rs 499, which comes with a validity of 365 days and a talk time of Rs 103.

This is less than 2 per cent of the total 51.6 lakh women thegovernmentseeks to benefit annually.As a result, in the next fiscal, thegovernmentwill have to provide cash benefits to double the number of women, while last yearsbudgetwould have lapsed.This shows that thegovernmentis not serious, said Dipa Sinha, convenor of the Right to Food campaign, who was among those who wrote to Jaitley.""By the government\'s own truncated estimate, 52 lakh women were to benefit from the scheme in the current financial year. But since only a fraction of them have received the cash transfer, it means thegovernmentneeds to now reach out to double the annual estimate in the next financial year and, therefore, should have at least sought twice the funds allocated last year,"" Sinha explained.She added that the scheme is violative of the NFSA, under which all pregnant and lactating mothers, exceptgovernmentemployees, are entitled to a sum of at least Rs 6,000.The PMMVY programme is, however, restricted to only one child per woman. The scheme also excludes any woman who already has a child today because it applies only to the birth of the first living child.Prime Minister Narendra Modi in a televised New Year Eve address to the nation on December 31, 2016 announced the pan-India expansion of the maternity benefit scheme which was until then being implemented across 56 districts as part of a pilot project.In May 2017, the Union Cabinet approved thePradhan Mantri Matru Vandana Yojanafor pregnant women and lactating mothers, effective from January 1, 2017.Under the scheme, a woman would receive Rs 5,000 in three instalments upon meeting different requirements and remaining Rs 1,000 under Janani Suraksha Yojana after institutional delivery.According to Sinha, by adding conditionalities such as institutional delivery for women to claim Rs 1,000 of the total Rs 6,000, thegovernmentis denying mothers their right under law.Maternity benefits became a legal entitlement in 2013 under the NFSA, which states, ""Subject to such schemes as may be framed by the central government, every pregnant and lactating mother shall be entitled to [nutritious food and] maternity benefit of not less than rupees six thousand, in such instalments as may be prescribed by the centralgovernment.']",/budget/article/budget-2018-govt-may-sidestep-demand-for-boost-to-maternity-benefit-scheme-118012900894_1.html

Be careful what you ask, Maria.When actressSonam Kapoorappeared on the cover ofElle Indiawearing a piece from Dior?s latest collection, this is why I was angry.In 2006, spurred on by requests for work from the women in the village where I live ? Mandi Gaon ? I started a tiny non-profit called The Knitwits. We created knitwear which I helped design, delivering materials to the houses of women who often weren?t able or allowed to leave, and later collecting finished pieces. But I had made a crucial mistake ? I had no buyer.These were the pre-Instagram, Facebook Store days and I began to wonder if I would have to go stand around at local crafts markets, when someone suggestedPeople Tree.I?d long been a fan of their t-shirts so made my way to the store to check if they were interested.I was led up a red ladder to an office crammed with books, baubles and crafts tools where Gurpreet Sidhu gave me my first business lesson. She took a good look at the knitwear I had carried, suggested what changes I could make in the next round, asked me how much I planned to pay the women, priced it fairly and asked one of her girls to put the scarves and hats in store.Nothing about the wayPeople Treeworks has changed. Not since 1990, when Sidhu and her husband Orijit Sen opened with a simple line of t-shirts. The philosophy?s always been the same: create original, beautiful, earth-friendly goods that tell a story, and help as many as you can in the process.Sidhu and Sen gave jobs to those in need, let their house be used as a centre of the arts, for blockprinting sessions, for refugees. They managed somehow to balance doing what businesses never do ? making a profit and making a difference. With a store a stone?s throw away from Jantar Mantar, they?ve always been witness to and actively involved in calls for justice over the years, becoming over time a haven for those straying from the mainstream, in fashion, politics or society.Which is why we were shocked to seeSonam Kapooron cover of the magazine in a dress from Dior?s Spring/Summer 2018 Ready To Wear Cruise Line, which looked exactly like it had been crafted byPeople Tree.The two garments, posted in the format below onto social media by Sen and Sidhu?s daughter Pakhi Sen, created a stir I doubt Dior quite thought was possible.In the initial backlash Pakhi Sen received from Dior fans, people went as far as to say the two fabrics looked nothing alike. This was when many like myself felt compelled to speak up. The similarities between the prints Dior print and thePeople Treeone are by no means minor:The colour ? the exact same rust red.Yoga pose 1 ? Padmasana.Yoga pose 2 ? Natarajasana.The flower ? whilePeople Treealternated the yoga poses with a lotus, Dior chose to use a tulip.The style of art.Sen, the original designer of the print, has since shared images of the first drawings and blocks made for it, dug up 15 years after he first created them.By no stretch of the imagination could this be a mere coincidence, as many on the internet insisted.More than Dior, it was celebrities who had posted wearing the dress, such as supermodel and TV host Alexa Chung, who came under fire. (Chung has since deleted the image off her Instagram, but here are images of her wearing the dress to the Dior Ball and show, where she had a front row seat.)Elle Indiaand their January cover modelSonam Kapoorreceived flak as well. This is where it gets complicated.Neither Chung, Kapoor norElle Magazineare at fault here. As an actress who is most likely advised by a team of sponsors and stylists (including her sister Rhea Kapoor) Kapoor may not have had much say in her outfit. Even if she had, let?s say she simply chose the one that looked good on her. Simple. What?s not so simple has been her silence on the issue since then. In an attempt to keep the big design house happy, Kapoor has kept mum about it.This, to many who follow and love her, is a real shame. Kapoor is better known for her impeccable dress choices and for promoting new indigenous designers than she is for her films. She?s frequently given unknown designers a foothold to reach out and touch the stars. For her not to say something, not to apologise for not knowing, or acknowledge the existence of People Tree, was heartbreaking.Some said thatPeople Treehad jumped the gun by using the Elle cover image, and they should have used a runway or stock image of the dress rather than drag the magazine into the mess. Here is how the two garments bearing the print appeared on the runway and on the Dior website now.It would have been impossible to make a point using these images. As a result,Elle Indiatook the heat. I repeat, Elle isn?t at fault. It?s disappointing that its fashion team did not know of People Tree?s design (both companies function out of Delhi), but it isn?t a crime.It does though beg the question ? how many times hasElle Indiafeatured garments from People Tree, an almost 30-year-old Indian design store making an impact, in the pages of their magazine? Is all fashion representation in magazines sponsored by design houses with astronomically priced wares? Where does Elle draw the line between what is truly fashionable, original and making an impact, and what they are paid to feature?Those are questions for another day. The question today is ? how on Earth did this happen?Christian Dior?s current creative director, Maria Grazia Chiuri is best known for launching her role at the design house by sending models down the ramp in t-shirts bearing the title of an essay by Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie: ?We Should All be Feminists?.While the T-shirts still shine bright in our memories, what has been quietly brushed under the carpet is that many of the pieces from the collection came under the radar for being exact replicas of traditional Romanian folk costumes.Is Chiuri to blame? The answer is complicated. Fashion houses like Dior don?t often have one single designer at the helm. Creative Director she may be, but the actual designing, print sourcing, and ideating is done by a team, sometimes made up of young designers under pressure to churn out original work that has the potential to become the next craze.Imagine for a moment one of these young designers. She has her dream job working under Chiuri at Dior, but the team is ideating for the Spring-Summer 2018 Collection and she?s tired and frankly has nothing to offer at the next day?s meeting. That evening she goes to a party in Manhattan?s Lower East Side. A girl walks in wearing a smashing dress in autumnal red, printed with what looks like poses from her yoga class.The designer walks up to her and compliments the dress. ?Oh thank you! Believe it or not, I bought it years ago at this cute little store in India!?Dior girl asks to take a photograph of it.', 'The next day at the meeting she hands it in. It?s approved. It could have been that simple. Chiuri may not have been the one to find the print or copy it ? I?d hope the person occupying the position once held by Yves Saint Laurent, Gianfranco Ferre and John Galliano knows better. But she should have better checks in place.']",/article/current-affairs/dior-s-dirty-laundry-how-a-bn-dollar-firm-failed-to-give-credit-yet-again-118013100204_1.html

Themoon orbits around the Earthand as a result we see different amounts of the lit-up side.', 'A full moon is when we see its entire lit-up side. This occurs every 29.5 days, when the moon is directly opposite the sun relative to the Earth. Jan. 31 will be ournext full moon in the lunar cycle.', 'What?s alunar eclipse?', 'The moon?s orbit is tilted by about 5 degrees relative to the Earth?s orbit. So, most of the time the moon ends up a little above or below the path Earth follows as it revolves around the sun. But twice in each lunar cycle, the moon doescross into our planet?s orbital plane.', 'If that crossing corresponds to a full moon, the moon will pass into the Earth?s shadow, resulting ina total lunar eclipse. Since the moon needs to be behind the Earth, relative to the sun, alunar eclipsecan only happen on a full moon.', 'To see the phenomenon, you need to be on the night side of the Earth;this eclipse will be visible mostlyin Asia, Australia, the Pacific and North America. But don?t worry if you miss it, lunar eclipses happen on average a couple times a year. The next one visible in North Americawill be on Jan. 21, 2019.', 'Ablue moonthat looks red', 'When alunar eclipsehappens, the moon appears to darken as it moves into the Earth?s shadow called the umbra. When the moon is all the way in shadow it doesn?t go completely dark; instead, it looks red due to aprocess called Rayleigh scattering. The gas molecules of Earth?s atmosphere scatter bluer wavelengths of light from the sun, while redder wavelengths pass straight through.', 'This is why we haveblue skies and red sunrises and sunsets.', 'When the sun is high in the sky, red light passes straight through to the ground while blue light is scattered in every direction, making it more likely to hit your eye when you look around.During a sunset, the angle of the sun is lower in the sky and that red light instead passes directly into your eyes while the blue light is scattered away from your line of sight.', 'In the case of a lunar eclipse, the sunlight that makes it around Earth passes through our atmosphere and is refracted toward the moon. Blue light is filtered out, leaving the moonlooking reddish during an eclipse.', 'On top of it all, the Jan. 31 full moon is also a considered ablue moon.There are two different definitions ofblue moon.The first is any time a second full moon occurs in a single month. Since there are 29.5 days between two full moons, we usually only end up with one per month. With most months longer than 29.5 days, it occasionally works out that we have two full moons. We already had one on the first of this month and our second will be Jan. 31, making it ablue moon.With this definition our nextblue moonis in March, leaving February with no full moon this year.', 'The second definition of ablue moonstates it?s thethird moon in a seasonin which there are four moons, whichhappens about every 2.7 years. We?ll only have three this winter, so the Jan. 31 full moon won?t be blue by this definition. Stargazers will need to wait until May 18, 2019, for ablue moonthat fits this older, original definition.', 'A supersized supermoon', 'Finally, to add the cherry on top, this will alsobe a supermoon. The moon?s orbit is not perfectly circular, meaning its distance from Earth varies as it goes through one cycle. The closest point in its orbit is called the perigee. A full moon that happens near perigee iscalled a supermoonby some.', 'This happened with our full moon earlier this month on Jan. 1 and will again on Jan. 31.', 'Its proximity makes it seem a little bit bigger and brighter than usual, but that?s the extent of its effects on Earth. The distinction is usually hard to notice unless you?re looking at two pictures side by side.', '', 'There are long traditions of givingdifferent moons names. This being a bigger, brighter, reddish-looking blue moon, perhaps we should call the next full moon the super purple moon.

Everyone, be warned.The government cautions that theDay Zerothreat will surpass anything a major city has faced since World War II or the Sept. 11 attacks. Talks are underway with South Africa?s police because ?normal policing will be entirely inadequate.? Residents, their nerves increasingly frayed, speak in whispers of impending chaos.The reason for the alarm is simple: The city?s water supply is dangerously close to running dry.If water levels keep falling,Cape Townwill declareDay Zeroin less than three months. Taps in homes and businesses will be turned off until the rains come. The city?s four million residents will have to line up for water rations at 200 collection points. The city is bracing for the impact on public health and social order.?WhenDay Zerocomes, they?ll have to call in the army,? said Phaldie Ranqueste, who was filling his white SUV with big containers of water at a natural spring where people waited in a long, anxious line.It wasn?t supposed to turn out this way forCape Town.This city is known for its strong environmental policies, including its careful management of water in an increasingly dry corner of the world.But after a three-year drought, considered the worst in over a century, South African officials sayCape Townis now at serious risk of becoming one of the few major cities in the world to lose piped water to homes and most businesses.Hospitals, schools and other vital institutions will still get water, officials say, but the scale of the shut-off will be severe.Cape Town?s problems embody one of the big dangers of climate change: the growing risk of powerful, recurrent droughts. In Africa, a continent particularly vulnerable to the effects of climate change, those problems serve as a potent warning to other governments, which typically don?t have this city?s resources and have done little to adapt.For now, political leaders here talk of coming together to ?defeatDay Zero.? As water levels in the dams supplying the city continue to drop, the city is scrambling to finishdesalinationplants and increase groundwater production. Starting in February, residents will face harsher fines if they exceed their new daily limit, which will go down to 50 liters (13.2 gallons) a day per person from 87 liters now.Just a couple of years ago, the situation could not have looked more different here. In 2014, the dams stood full after years of good rain. The following year, C40, a collection of cities focused on climate change worldwide, awardedCape Townits ?adaptation implementation? prize for its management of water.Cape Townwas described as one of the world?s top ?green? cities, and the Democratic Alliance ? the opposition party that has controlledCape Townsince 2006 ? took pride in its emphasis on sustainability and the environment.The accolades recognised the city?s success in conserving water. Though the city?s population had swelled by 30 percent since the early 2000s, overall water consumption had remained flat. Many of the new arrivals settled in the city?s poor areas, which consume less water, and actually helped bring down per capita use.The city?s water conservation measures ? fixing leaks and old pipes; installing meters and adjusting tariffs ? had a powerful impact. Maybe too powerful.The city conserved so much water that it postponed looking for new sources.For years,Cape Townhad been warned that it needed to increase and diversify its water supply. Almost all of its water still comes from six dams dependent on rainfall, a risky situation in an arid region with a changing climate.', 'The dams, which were full only a few years ago, are now down to about 26 percent of capacity, officials say.']",/article/international/dangerously-low-on-water-cape-town-to-face-day-zero-within-months-118013100182_1.html

While his impromptu tweets and remarks are more prone to be inaccurate or unfounded, the president?s prepared speeches tend to be more tempered, even if they have taken facts out of context, included overstated or undue self-praise or offered bleak and exaggerated diagnoses.Here are some lessons and themes drawn from a year of fact-checking Trump?s public remarks, interviews and social media posts as president.Policy achievementsTrump has been unable to fulfill one of his central campaign pledges ? repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act ? but it hasn?t stopped him from falsely declaring otherwise. In some remarks, Trump has been accurate, describing the end of the health care law?s individual mandate as ?partial repeal.? Virtually all other parts of the law remain intact.It is also not accurate for Trump to claim full credit for the collapse of the Islamic State?s self-proclaimed caliphate in Syria and Iraq. A significant amount of territory has been recaptured and major battles have been won in the last year, but Trump has largely overseen a strategy started under President Barack Obama.The $1.5 trillion tax cut signed by Trump in December is his first major legislative achievement in office. But he is wrong to characterize it ? as he has done at least four times this year ? as the largest in history (at least three are bigger) or the first since President Ronald Reagan?s 1981 tax cut (most presidents since Reagan have cut taxes).The ?Trump bump? in the economyTrump is likely to boast about a roaring American economy and healthy job growth, though his claims should be viewed in context.He has, for example, boasted at least seven times in the past two weeks that the black unemployment rate, 6.8 percent in December, is the lowest ever recorded. While true, it is the culmination of a longer-term trend. It is also an open question how much credit a president, especially in his first year, can take for the economy.The same can be said of Trump?s repeated claim that nearly 2.4 million jobs have been added since his election in November 2016. The number is accurate, but appears less groundbreaking with the appropriate context: More jobs were added in the 14 months before his election than in the 14 months since.Trump has also misrepresented the tax cut?s effect on the decisions of American businesses.Contrary to his claims that Chrysler is ?leaving Mexico and coming back to the United States,? the automaker continues to operate several plants in Mexico even as it shifts production of some pickup trucks to Michigan. Similarly, he has trumpeted Apple?s announcement of a $350 billion, five-year investment as a boon for manufacturing, but the company was already on track to spend $275 billion over the next five years.InternationaldealsTrump often talks up his deal-making prowess.', 'But he has taken credit for agreements that were drawn up before he was involved or relies on fuzzy math to promote the most impressive dollar figure possible.']",/article/international/state-of-the-union-how-truthful-was-trump-in-his-first-year-as-president-118013100146_1.html

The decision to highlight areas for possible cooperation across the aisle and to frame the president?s remarks around stories of exceptional Americans is a tacit admission that Trump is addressing a Congress and a country sharply divided by the opening year of his administration.Softer ToneControversy over the probe into his campaign?s possible collusion with Russia has been heightened in recent days by his administration?s decision to largely avoid imposing new sanctions on Russia and a bid by congressionalRepublicansto release a memo in which they allege improper behavior by FBI leadership investigating the president.Trump planned to steer clear of those controversies in his speech, said a person familiar with the text. He will instead devote his remarks to the idea that an improving economy has helped all Americans. Central to that argument is a celebration of the tax cuts, passed byRepublicanstoward the end of last year, and a promise to crackdown on what Trump considers to be unfair trade arrangements.?America has also finally turned the page on decades of unfair trade deals that sacrificed our prosperity and shipped away our companies, our jobs and our nation?s wealth,? he will say.In striking a softer tone, the White House hopes to win back voters who appear to be abandoning the president and his party ahead of upcoming midterm elections, according to polls.', 'Trump also seeks to encourage lawmakers in the throes of an immigration policy debate and still smarting from a dispute that led to a brief government shutdown to consider Trump?s policy priorities.']",/article/international/donald-trump-speech-we-have-arrived-at-new-american-moment-of-prosperity-118013100123_1.html

Here are our observations:Samsung MallTheGalaxy On7 Primeis the first smartphone to feature the Samsung Mall app, which promises to enhance users? shopping experience by making product search easier. However, in real-life scenario, the app has its hits and misses.The Mall feature works through a dedicated app or camera interface. To make a search, you need to click a photo of the product and the mall app would make an online search for it across e-commerce platforms to look for products matching the photograph. The app shows close results and compares the prices, too. But the result is not always correct; sometimes it shows irrelevant results.DesignFor a smartphone with a 5.5-inch screen, the Galaxy On7 comes across as huge and with its share of avoidable design flaws. The front is dominated by a 16:9 aspect ratio screen, which leaves huge bezels on the top and bottom. The fingerprint scanner is placed under the home button at the bottom of the screen, along with capacitive option and back key, to utilise the bottom bezel.The back looks old-school with a three-piece bland design, which uses metal at the centre and plastic blocks on the top and bottom. The power button is placed on the right side, along with a mono speaker right above it.', 'Volume rocker keys, SIM card slots and the microSD card slot are on the left side.DisplayThe smartphone?s 5.5-inch fullHD (1920 x 1080) 16:9 aspect ratio screen works optimally. The touch is responsive and the display renders good contrast and saturation. However, the sunlight legibility, viewing angles and peak brightness levels are not very impressive, considering that the screen is from the TFT breed.CameraAs for imaging capabilities, the On7 Prime has a 13-megapixel shooter with a bright f/1.9 aperture on the rear and front. The rear camera offers satisfactory image quality but the interface leaves you a little confused sometimes. The photographs come out sharp, with satisfactory details in good-light scenarios, and the low-light performance is on par with other budget smartphones.The selfie camera, on the other hand, is a capable one. With face detection enabled, the front camera focuses quickly and takes detailed shots.PerformanceThe On7 Prime hosts the Exynos 7870 octa-core processor, developed in-house by Samsung and offering enough power to manage and run tasks smoothly. However, the power-intensive apps like Asphalt 8 take a toll on the computing prowess and the processor shows some signs of weakness.The device boots the Android Nougat 7.1 covered under the Samsung user interface preloaded with some bloatware and apps. The interface is mostly clean but far from perfect.BatteryThe phone?s 3,350 mAh battery keeps the show running for more than a day, even on operating processor-intensive tasks like gaming, video streaming and music playback. The phone does heat up a little but not so much as might cause discomfort.VerdictTheGalaxy On7 Primeoffers a satisfactory performance in the sub-Rs 15,000 price segment.

The difference between the market value and the declared value of properties at the time of registration gives the extent of under-reported income.The current regime of taxation on land andreal estateincentivises widespread tax evasion, and generation and use ofblack money.At present, there is a plethora of taxes levied by different authorities on land andreal estate(See Table: Important taxes & charges on land &real estatepost 1 July 2017) which leads to cascading of taxes thereby increasing the distortionary impact of taxes on efficiency and productivity of thereal estatemarket.The present regime of transfer, registration and stamp duties, all being transaction-centric taxes, are amenable to inclusion within theGSTbase asGSTis also a transactions tax. Inclusion ofreal estatewithin theGSTfold will help in minimising the overall tax burden in absolute rupee terms."", 'This will, in turn, enhance the elasticity and buoyancy of India?s indirect tax system, because the audit trail inGSTwill bring a greater proportion ofreal estatetransactions into the tax net, augmenting the revenue collection.GSTleaves a digital trail of transactions, which becomes a disincentive and deterrent for non-reporting or under-reporting of the sale value of the land or building, and thereby reduces the shadow economy.']",/article/economy-policy/real-estate-under-gst-a-great-weapon-in-the-war-against-black-money-118013100580_1.html

Simultaneous polls will also ensure that development work is not stopped every few months because of the imposition of the model code of conduct.Why then is the Opposition opposed to the move?For starters, not just the Opposition but several other constitutional experts, have pointed out practical problems in implementing ?one nation one poll?.Secondly, the Opposition is deeply suspicious of the PM?s intent in pushing for simultaneous polls. It believes the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is set to lose assembly elections in Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan, which are due in December. This will weaken its momentum going into the Lok Sabha polls that are scheduled to take place in April-May 2019. However, simultaneous polls would ensure a presidential election type campaign of Modi versus the rest of opposition leaders, and subsume local issues in states like Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh. The latest example of this was in Gujarat, where the PM?s blitzkrieg of an election campaign was the difference between the BJP?s win and an embarrassing defeat because of widespread anger over farm distress and GST (goods and services tax) implementation.Let?s first take the Opposition views on the practicality of simultaneous polls.Senior Congress leader P Chidambaram, a noted constitutional lawyer, said on Tuesday that Modi?s ?one nation one poll? was yet another ""election jumla"", or gimmick. He said it cannot be done under the current constitutional provisions.Chidambaram said the Constitution of India does not give a fixed term to any government and unless it is amended, one cannot havesimultaneous elections.?This is another of this election jumla. One nation, one tax was a jumla. Now, \'one nation, one election\' is a jumla,"" he said, at the launch of a book authored by him.Chidamabaram said one can artificially construct the appearance of a simultaneous election by advancing some elections and postponing some, and one could hold parliamentary election and elections to five or six states, but not in all the 30 states. ""What if a government falls tomorrow? Will you put it under President\'s rule for four years? It can\'t be done,"" he said. Chidambaram pointed out the case of Germany, where provinces go to polls at different times. At the same event, Congress Lok Sabha member Shashi Tharoor said simultaneous polls was a good idea, but not practicable. He said better solutions needed to be found to some of the practical problems.Recently, Communist Party of India (Marxist) chief Sitaram Yechury said his party would support simultaneous polls, but only if the Modi government also agreed to repeal Article 356 of the Constitution, that has been misused often to dismiss state governments. He has also termed simultaneous polls as anti-democratic and to subvert parliamentary democracy.On the second issue of trust deficit, Congress leader RPN Singh puts it succinctly. ?They couldn?t ensure simultaneous polls for Himachal Pradesh and Gujarat this time, when these two states have gone to polls together for nearly two decades,? he said.', 'But the real reason that Modi is canvassing support for simultaneous polls, Congress leaders say, is purely from electoral motivations.']",/article/politics/why-opposition-parties-are-not-enthused-about-one-nation-one-election-118013100723_1.html

If news reports are to be believed, the Congress, which has 54 members in the Rajya Sabha, is not too keen on being part of the campaign to remove Justice Misra. Even if theCongressdecides to not jump onto the bandwagon, the Communists would still have the minimum numbers with the help of other parties to initiate a motion in theRajya Sabha.Some of the dark horses in this quest could be theAam Aadmi Party(four members) andAll India Dravida Munetra Kazhagam(13 members) who could go either way, depending on their political interests. (See graphic)In theLok Sabhatoo, if the Communists get the support of the same parties that are backing it in the Rajya Sabha, it could ratchet up 173 MPs. With the minimum requirement of 100 MPs, the CPM could initiate a notice in theLok Sabhaas well.While giving a notice to remove Justice Misra in theRajya Sabhamay be easy withCongressbacking, the rest of the process may be paved with impediments that the Communists may not be able to circumvent with ease. The Judges Inquiry Bill, 1968 states that once the notice is given, the speaker of the House may or may not accept the motion. In case the Communists take theRajya Sabharoute, this discretion would lie withRajya SabhachairmanVenkaiah Naidu.If Naidu accepts the motion, he will be required to constitute a three-member judicial committee to frame specific charges against Justice Misra on the basis of which an investigation would be conducted against him. This is where things could get tricky. The three members of the committee need to include a Chief Justice or a judge of the Supreme Court, a chief justice of any high court and a ?distinguished jurist.?With fourSupreme Courtjudges openly antagonistic to Justice Misra, there could potentially be questions raised over the composition of the committee formed to investigate charges against him. The inclusion or exclusion of the hostile judges -? Justices J Chelameswar, Ranjan Gogoi,Madan LokurandKurian Joseph?- from the committee to investigate charges against Justice Misra would create its own set of complications.The Communists could also be racing against time in their quest for removing Justice Misra from the highest judicial office in the country. Justice Misra is slated to retire as theChief Justice of Indiaon October 2, 2018. This effectively gives the Communists two Parliamentary sessions -? the ongoingBudget sessionand the monsoon session -? to achieve its stated target.', 'Once Justice Misra demits office later this year, none of these motions or reports would have any bearing on him. The Judges Inquiry Act ,1968 does not mandate any time limit within which the judicial committee needs to submit its report to the chairman of theRajya Sabha.']",/article/current-affairs/impeaching-cji-dipak-misra-are-the-communists-living-in-fool-s-paradise-118013100784_1.html

Starting with a Rs 10,000 startup fund in the 2014 Budget, the government followed it up with a Rs 1,000 crore fund for tech startups and entrepreneurs in the 2015 budget, a 100 percent tax holiday for startups for the first three years of existence in 2016 and a further tax exemption in 2017 (25% for smaller companies) to make startups one of the very important cogs in the Indian economy?s wheel.While the government?s continuous push to bolster the startup ecosystem has undoubtedly come and helped the startup ecosystem, following are the two significant anticipations from theUnion Budget 2018-2019.1. Financial assistance to help Startups attract top talentAttracting top talent is critical to the success of any startup. Startups compete for talent with multinationals, and cannot offer large cash packages as compared to large competitors. We propose the following two ways in which the downside of joining a startup can be minimized for high-quality talent-a. The Government can look at lowering the income tax slabs for startup employees, which will not only keep the talent motivated but also help in retaining themb. Joining a startup may lead to an unsecured retired life. For small setups, benefits like PF may not apply. Therefore, the Government can provide support to such employees by contributing a portion of retiral/ pension schemesPart of 10,000 crore fund can be used for the above two ?direct support? schemes which will benefit all eligible startups without any administrative costs being incurred. (Investing in startups via intermediary funds include a management/ administrative fee).2. Simplification and faster execution of existing schemesWhile the Government approved the establishment of Rs 10,000 crore Fund of Funds (FFS) scheme in June 2016, only Rs 600* crore has been released to Small Industries Development Bank of India (SIDBI) by the Finance Ministry. Point to be noted is the fact that the disbursal of funds to startups after sanctioning of funds to venture capital funds (VCFs) has a time lag of two-three years.In addition to the funds, the Government must also look at simplifying the taxation arrangement under which only 74* startups have been approved last year. Approvals from DIPP, and then from IMB for taxation benefits have turned out to be a tedious process. One alternative can be assisting startups by diminishing their cost in the premature years rather than giving them tax holidays in the first three years since the maximum companies do not make any profit in the primary years.Strategies like direct tax benefits and capital availability that work to promote large-scale business may not be the best strategies for startups. Startups have the inherent advantage of being nimble, cost-efficient and innovative. The Government should also imbibe these virtues as it comes up with strategies to create a vibrant startup ecosystem in the country. For all we know, India may lead the world by setting up a Startup Ministry!The author is founder of i2e1, a start-up that deals in internet delivery to businesses']",/budget/article/budget-2018-easy-compliance-sops-to-help-start-ups-create-more-jobs-118013100818_1.html

There was growing criticism of thehealthprofession. Errors in diagnosis, wrong procedures, misinforming patients, and failure of peer networks to report poor practice, etc. started gaining attention. This happens because ofinformation asymmetry:situations where one party to a transaction has more or better information than the other. Due to the complexity and uncertainty of medical treatment, patients were unable to evaluate the quality of service being provided. In turn,doctorsexercised undue influence over patients. Some common problems with doctors, like unnecessary tests, operations and prescriptions are explained by this theory.', 'Kenneth Arrow, in hisseminal paperon medical care, showed that medicine was plagued withinformation asymmetry.

Expectations about rationalisation of tax rates are high among individuals and corporates, while economists are closely tracking adherence to fiscal discipline. Amidst all the voices, the investment community too is looking forward to clarity on a few issues.Long-term capital gains ? will the yearly debate come to a close?At present, capital gains on listed securities are exempt from tax, provided, the security has been held for more than a year and the Securities Transaction Tax has been paid on both purchase and sale transactions. With Indian public equity markets experiencing a sustained bull-run for the past few years, the on-going debate on taxability of capital gains on listed securities has gained fresh momentum in the build up to the UnionBudget.Constant pressure on the government to augment tax receipts, absence of comparable international jurisprudence, resultant inequitable tax treatment to other assets classes such as real estate and gold, make a case for a re-look at this exemption. However, any move to tax capital gains is likely to evoke sharp reactions and the possibility of a downward correction of the markets could be one repercussion. Alternatives such as extending the prescribed holding period from one to three years, making exemption subject to reinvestment of capital gains, or capping the exempt gains to a prescribed amount, may be considered by the government to neutralise the possibility of a negative impact. Investors will keenly watch the upcoming UnionBudget2018-19 to see if the government finally walks the tightrope and deals with the issue of taxability of capital gains.Cryptocurrencies ? Need for clarityThe rate of growth in the value of cryptocurrencies and the surrounding tax and regulatory issues have constantly tried to outpace each other in the past year. From an Indian policy standpoint, the government is evaluating a report by an expert committee on the existing global regulations governing crypto currencies and the central bank has repeatedly cautioned public of the inherent related risks. As per reports, the government is even toying with the idea of launching its own cryptocurrency and while that maybe one reality, the other is the Income-tax department recently launching search operations at various cryptocurrency exchanges across the country with notices being issued to individuals on the basis of information collected.In the absence of any clear regulation in India, ambiguity remains on the legality and other issues like taxability which investors would wish to be addressed in the UnionBudget2018-19. The primary issue of classification as a currency or a capital asset would need to be addressed by the central bank and will form the basis of determining taxability. Other potential issues include taxability of income as capital gains or business income which, inter-alia, can be determined by the intention of the purchaser and the frequency and volumes of trading. Being intangible, cryptocurrencies are devoid of specific identification and issues like determination of cost of acquisition and period of holding of the cryptocurrency sold requires clarification. Applicability of the First In, First Out (FIFO) method to resolve such issues, in line with dematerialised securities, requires specific clarification.Other challenges such as requirement to pay advance tax on gains realized during the year, determining the situs of cryptocurrencies, taxability in India of trades implemented by non-residents through Indian exchanges and taxability in the hands of cryptocurrency miners also require detailed guidelines.

While there are several expectations of key announcements for theeconomyand its various sectors, it remains to be soon whom the finance minister would oblige this time.Here is a snapshot of theBudget 2018 Expectationsof Rita Singh, chairman & managing director of Mesco Steel, on key issues:1. Reduction of import duty on Coking Coala. Currently import duty on Coking Coal is 2.5% and many of the steel companies are dependent upon imported coking coal as the domestic quality is not suitable for the steel industry, due to higher ash content.b. The import duty to be levied should be NIL as this would in turn help the steel industry to reduce the raw material cost and would increase productionc. During FY18 (April ? September), 22.6 MT of coking coal was imported. India?s coking coal imports have increased by 9.9% y-o-y basisd. The removal of import duty would help in reducing the cost of producing the end product and would help to increase the profitability of steel companies, which would in turn benefit the industry as well aseconomyas a whole2. Indian steel companies are also requesting for exemption from Environmental Cess.3. Removal of import duty on stainless steel scrap:For the manufacturing of stainless steel in electric furnace, stainless steel scrap is the key raw material. This scrap is not available in India and has to be imported and hence Customs duty on import of scrap may be reduced to NIL from current duty of 2.5%.4. Boost in Infrastructure developmenta. The domestic consumption of steel per capita is around 65 kg only compared to global average, which is 235kg, which indicates a huge gap in per capita consumption in India.b. India being the 3rd largest steel producer in India need to match up global standard and need to improve its per capita domestic consumption through investment in various infrastructure projects in semi?urban and rural areas.c. Initiatives like ?Make in India? is expected to boost the investment in infrastructure and thereby on demand for domestic steel would also increase.d. Where the Steel Ministry is estimating to increase the per capita steel consumption to the level of 160 kg by 2030 from the existing level, initiatives should be created to increase the domestic consumption by investment more in smart cities, affordable housing, overall infrastructure development of the country which would indirectly not only help Steel industry, but also many other industry such as cement, automobiles, housing etc. industry also.5. Reduction in export duty on Iron Ore upto 62% Fe (Ferrous Content)a.

The sector logged a healthy 8 percent revenue growth in the first half of fiscal 2017, but failed to sustain momentum thereafter following demonetization of high-value notes. This restricted full-year growth to just 6 percent on-year.GST ImpactIn August 2016, the GST bill was passed by the Indian Parliament. It was levied on as many as 178 products, including chocolates, cosmetics, detergents and air-fresheners etc. Some firms operating in categories such as FMCG, consumer electronics and food retail reaped the benefits in the form of reduced logistics costs and lowering of taxes. However, other segments, such as soft drink manufacturers and e-tailers have had to pay higher taxes. Many companies like HUL passed on this cost advantage to the end consumer, but quite a few others did not. Especially those that carried long pipeline stocks did not pass on the advantage despite the government making it clear that it was the responsibility of the companies to ensure that their entire retail is directing to announce this to the end user.E-commerceThis got a huge fillip, thanks to demonetization and GST, andaided FMCG sector on an everyday level. Monthly groceries that were traditionally cash and carry were now going cashless. The adoption to this online mechanism has been surprisingly quick, compared to expectations. Aggregators like big basket or Amazon grocery, are trying a new route to deepen relationships with consumers.Corresponding to the growth of e commerce, one saw the decline in Television advertising paving way to viral marketing in social media. Brands getting marketed through this medium increased. Examples included new screens/modes like Netflix, Hotstar, Jio movies, endangering the blockbuster/events driven advertising which has been the mainstay of FMCG advertising. Even Nestle relaunched its noodles via Snapdeal, a tribute to the reach of E-commerce.What to expect in FMCG -2018?Favorable demographics and rise in income level will boost FMCG market in 2018. This industry in India is expected to grow at a CAGR of 20.6 per cent and is expected to reach US$ 103.7 billion by 2020 from US$ 49 billion in 2016. Growing awareness, easier access, and changing lifestyles are the key growth drivers for the consumer market. The Government of India's policies and regulatory frameworks such as GST and demonetization are expected to drive demand, both in the rural and urban areas, and economic growth in a structured manner in the long term and improve performance of companies within the sector.Quarterly growth trends are positive for the industry already, but that is partly also because the comparison basis of last year same quarter was low! Some other trends to look forward to:· \xa0Ethnic positioning seems to be gaining favor- some examples are Paper boat beverages from Hector, Cheddar foods into the banana/tapioca chips segment as against KFC ( shutting down in some places) to Dominos that has reported slow growth. Western trends in foods seems to have slowed down and desi is clearly up.·Fitness/Health- this is expected to grow more... Consumer awareness in this area fueled by ?organic? farm foods and gym/work out areas- this is one segment that will continue to bring in the money.Rural is picking up demand.Semi-urban and urban segments accounted for a revenue share of 40 per cent in the overall revenues recorded by FMCG sector in India. Affordability will be the primary focus as companies target the rural folks. Smaller unit packs that encourage bottom of the pyramid to purchase products will be seen more and more. Britannia?s Tiger is going to see revival in packaging and in distribution/availability. Dabur is revamping its Dabur Red toothpaste. Patanjali is further entering rural India with its various brands.EXPECTATIONS FROM 2018 BUDGET-for FMCGAs per a report, makers of Fast moving consumer goods (FMCG) are expected to see nearly 15% revenue growth in the quarter ending December 31, 2017. The reason provided for the growth is improved consumer sentiment and rise in rural demandFrom a FMCG perspective, for GST benefits to reach the consumers, organizations like Mars (confectionary) are investing in instore technology to ensure monitoring of this.Dabur, which makes Vatika shampoo and Fem skin-care products, plans to release ads telling consumers about the price reductions as well as to monitor the trade closely. Kolkata based Emami is also planning to do similar things.Analysts expect tax policy for cigarettes to be soft, with an anticipation of an increase in excise duty on cigarettes by 10 percent across slabs and also the likely introduction of 59-mm segment in the current slab structure.Given the above importance of rural in fueling the economy, thebudgetis expected to favor this segment. The plan of ?double rural income in the next 5 years? may get further clarity on its implementation.In order to boost e commerce, miniaturized Point of Sale (POS) card reader for m-POS, iris scanners, fingerprint readers/scanners and micro ATM standards version 1.5.1 that have been exempted from BCD, excise/ Countervailing Duty (CVD) and Special Additional Duty (SAD), will continue that way.According to CRISIL, overall FMCG is to see volume-driven growth and improved margins. However, rising input prices of raw materials such as crude oil and milk will restrict further margin expansion.The author is Associate Professor ?

Given the fact that thisbudgetis going to be the lastbudgetof the ruling government before the 2019 general election, expectations of the market are varying from populist to surprise to stringent measures that the government is likely to take (especially, since this government has followed this approach in past).We expect thebudgetto be not so populist. The government has been making a serious attempt to bring theBudgetcloser to what it essentially is ? a mere accounting and allocation exercise and it would continue to do so this year as well.We expect the government to initiate measures and allocate funds effectively to revive investments and alleviate rural distress which would create the much needed jobs and drive the growth momentum. We also look forward to see what the government does to remain on the glide path of fiscal consolidation.The government has built fiscal credibility during the last three years by achieving the targeted levels. This year, the structural changes led by demonetisation and GST have exerted challenges to the government to achieve the current year?s target. Concerns are thus high about how the government will manoeuvre public expenditure towards rural and infrastructure segments.Therefore, the UnionBudgetof 2018-19 is likely to thrust on the following major areas:A slip on fiscal deficit targetWe believe the slippage in the fiscal deficit target to be modest. Given the structural change in the indirect taxation system, a deviation in the fiscal deficit, if small, should not impact the rating of the government?s performance. Given that GST is eventually expected to broaden the tax base and generate more revenue, the initial shortfall should be overlooked unless a major deficit is recorded.We believe the gap in fiscal deficit to be supported by higher-than-budgeted small savings collections as the government has cut the interest rate on small savings deposits including PPF for the last quarter of FY18. The government has been able to meet the disinvestment target this year and the target has been revised upwards to cover the shortfall in non-tax revenue. On the other hand, a shortfall in non-tax revenue is anticipated as revenue realisation from telecom spectrum sale may not materialise.We believe that the government will stick to its earlier fiscal deficit target of 3.0% for FY19. There are, however, concerns regarding high food subsidy, interest outgo owing to affordable housing, high fuel subsidy and expected higher capex allocation forrural developmentwhich is likely to increase the expenditurebudgetof the government. However, we believe that once the GST process normalises, increase in GST returns will be higher than FY18. This coupled with increase in direct tax collections as the economy is expected to clock in a higher growth rate which will help the government to stay put on path of fiscal consolidation.1. Agriculture and Rural DevelopmentAgriculture andrural developmentis likely to get greater focus in terms of allocation of funds and direction of measures. Resources need to be redirected towards more structural reforms required in place of short term measures like farm loan waivers.We believe increase in net irrigated area (percentage of Gross Irrigated Area over Gross Cropped Area is little more than 45%), effective implementation of crop insurance, expansion of agricultural marketing under National Agriculture Market (e-NAM) and improving post-harvest infrastructure such as warehouses and cold storage would ensure effective price realisation and address the issue of commodity price volatility. We expect the government to direct its funds in the above areas.The government has already set up a committee to chart out initiatives to double the farmers? income by 2022. \xa0The model contract farming act to counter price risks has also been drafted by the centre. We hope that the measures the government adopts should achieve the following i.e. ensuring fair price realisation of agricultural products, establishing a strong agri-logistic infrastructure, wider coverage of irrigation network along with providing the farmers a risk cover against price volatility. We believe thatrural developmentwould get a major leap if the interconnectivity is enhanced. Connectivity for greater market access for commercial activities, connectivity for access to health and education and connectivity to financial network of institutions and market has been a long standing need. In this context, the concept of rurbanisation introduced by the government in its 2014budgetneeds to be reinvigorated. While the process of identification and approval of Rurban clusters in various states is in progress, the action plan should be accelerated.2. InfrastructureWhile the government has taken infrastructure related initiatives outside the preview of the Union Budget, it is the capital expenditure which is likely to get special attention during this year?sbudget.Reviving investments will continue to remain the focus area, especially as the sentiment of private players remains subdued. The government has continued its thrust towards infrastructure during the course of the year and we expect higher allocation in the next year as well. While the government reports the state of implementation of itsbudgetannouncements every year, it is difficult to estimate the extent and nature of spending in the overall infrastructure sector. A reporting of the aggregate spending will be quite useful in this regard. Rural infrastructure, urban transportation, solar power, inland waterways and overall green infrastructure is expected to receive impetus during thebudget.a) LogisticsThe government has initiated many projects such as Bharatmala, Sagarmala, UDAN, etc. to overhaul the logistic sector and has placed an emphasis on green infrastructure. These commendable initiatives need to be followed through to completion to ensure that these are executed in target timelines. The thrust on creating green infrastructure is expected to continue while there could be higher allocation for the transport sector considering the need for improvising public transport. Thrust on the big ticket projects, Bharatmala and Sagarmala, will eventually benefit this sector. There should be an increased thrust to create multimodal logistics parks since logistics cost remains very high.b) Affordable housingIncrease in deduction limit on principal repayment and on interest payment for housing loans is expected.c) PowerProviding land for solar manufacturers on a long term lease, higher allocation for development of grid infrastructure and incentive schemes for R&D are expected.d) Infrastructure financeSignificant surge in the infrastructure financing can be challenging for the government given risk on fiscal deficit. Hence, measures to attract private funds and foreign funds could be expected. Announcement of measures to revive public-private partnerships and creation of an asset recycling strategy or monetisation of government assets to ensure flow of funds for stepping-up public expenditure is expected. Provisions for deepening the infrastructure finance ecosystem such as channelising of insurance and pension funds for infrastructure projects could be announced.3. Manufacturing SectorThe expectations of continued thrust on the overall infrastructure sector and renewed focus on the agriculture sector are likely to provide derived demand to multiple manufacturing sectors like Cement, Steel, Aluminium, Plastics, Automotive etc. In order to provide a boost to the Government?s ?Make in India? Programme, some products that go as raw materials in certain finished products would see customs duty relaxation.At the same time, upward revision in customs duty on certain finished products is expected, so as to encourage domestic manufacturing. \xa0As part of the Government?s ease of doing business initiatives, theBudgetis expected to see measures aimed at relaxing the customs regime for companies, including release of imported items without any upfront duty payment.Although we do not expect a significant cut in corporate tax rate, considering the wide gap between estimated and actual realisation of GST revenues, we expect Indian businesses to get marginal relief on the corporate tax front.SOME KEY SECTORAL EXPECTATIONS:? Automobiles:The sector can expect increased demand if the Government announces financial incentives to replace vehicles older than 10-15 years. We expect theBudgetto announce certain incentives for electric vehicle (EV) manufacturing companies and on EV charging infrastructure and duty rationalization on certain imported parts for EVs. Higher bus orders are expected under the JNNURM scheme. Measures for the agriculture sector to push income levels also augur well for the automobiles sector, particularly two-wheelers and trucks.? Capital goods and engineering:A higher budgetary allocation to the infrastructure sector would drive order books of capital goods and engineering companies. We also expect increased budgetary allocation to the defence sector, which augurs well for the capital goods sector and commercial vehicle manufacturers.? BFSI sector:The UnionBudgetis expected to provide some relief to insurance sector by changing the tax incentives structure. The insurance businesses are impacted by higher GST rate. Hence, an increase in the tax deduction limit might provide some relief to insurance holders. We expect the UnionBudgetto provide more clarity on recapitalisation bonds for PSU banks and a roadmap on consolidation of PSU banks. The government could allow 100% FDI in private sector banks. Further, few measures to incentivise flow of credit to affordable housing and MSMEs are expected.The thrust on digital transactions is likely to strengthen as the UnionBudgetcould provide incentives on digital transactions up to a certain limit for small businesses. \xa0There could also be a push for e-Sign and e-KYC.? Consumer Goods:TheBudgetis expected to announce incentives for setting up warehouses and cold chain facilities and measures to increase foreign investments in the sector.? Gems & Jewellery:To revive demand for gold in the country and boost exports of jewellery, the UnionBudgetis expected to announce reduction in import duty on gold.? Textiles & Garments:To boost exports of textiles & garments, the Government may increase the duty drawback rates from the existing 2%.The author is Lead Economist - \u200eDun & Bradstreet India']",/budget/article/budget-2018-will-look-to-revive-investments-alleviate-rural-distress-118013101034_1.html

In its journey so far, agriculture and allied sector has played and will continue to play a significant role in providing employment and sustainable livelihoods for the growing population in India. Over 58 per cent of the rural households depend on agriculture as their principal means of livelihood. As per the 2nd revised estimates by the Central Statistics Office (CSO), the share of agriculture and allied sectors (including agriculture, livestock, forestry and fishery) is estimated to be 17.3 per cent of the Gross Value Added (GVA) during 2016-17 at 2011-12 prices.The pattern of agricultural holdings and the profile of agricultural households in India indicate that there is a dominance of small farmers and small farm holdings in the agricultural sector, who are highly indebted and are vulnerable to shocks and poverty. In line with other economic activities, agriculture entails various risks attached with it owing to issues of inputs, market prices, credit and other policy domains. Managing and reducing these risks can increase the incomes, profitability and ensure stable income flows to the farmers.The Economic Survey 2016-17 classified the overall risks entailed in agriculture under the following heads: Production risks? Weather & Disaster related risks? Price risks? Credit risks? Market risks and Policy risksThe Survey of 2016-17 had suggested several corrective measures aimed at solving farm sector issues. It was suggested to have a check on the skewed distribution of fertilizer subsidies, pricing policies and the resultant imbalances in the usage of fertilizers to retain the soil fertility. Dealing with the issues of water stress requires promotion and shifting to efficient water usage, micro irrigation techniques like drip and sprinkler irrigation. Effective use of weather/climate forecasts along with advanced IT and communication techniques can come handy for mitigating the weather related risks. Catering to the risks posed by price fluctuations and existing market mechanism, the solution lies in shifting to new seed varieties that have a longer shelf life and a shorter maturity time. Expanding the domain of formal sources of credit to the marginalized and distressed farmers uniformly throughout the country can help them move out of the vicious cycle of debt trap. The minimum support price (MSP) backed procurement of crops by Government agencies, intends to benefit the farmers directly. To make farming remunerative, Direct Benefit transfer(DBT) of inputs would be of great help to the farmers. The Survey also focused on removing the restrictions on internal trade on agricultural commodities and dismantling the fragmented legislations governing agriculture to let the real benefits flow down to the farmers sitting at the base of the pyramid. The stock limits imposed under Essential Commodities Act, 1955 ended up curtailing demand for farm produce. It was suggested to carry out the rationalisation of this limit to cover the price fluctuation risks.The last three fiscals have witnessed the Government taking action towards many of these gaps and irregularities. Addressing the deteriorating soil fertility affecting agricultural yield, the soil health card initiative and the Direct Benefit Transfer on fertilizers were introduced. There has been a substantial increase in the availability of certified quality seeds for wheat, paddy, barley, maize and potato over the previous year records. Targeting water stress and irrigation related risks, micro irrigation system was introduced on a pilot basis. The result was found to be favorable across many states covering Rajasthan, Odisha & Haryana. Owing to the price risks, farmers are encouraged to adopt a stable pattern of sowing so that in the long run, they receive a stable price of the produce. Promoting the formal credit market, the corpus of Long term Rural Credit Fund of NABARD was increased to Rs. 15,000 crore in 2016-17. Under the Interest Subvention Scheme (ISS) in 2016-17, farmers availed crop loans up to Rs. 3 lakh at 7 per cent interest and the effective rate of interest was lowered to 4 percent for those who repaid their loans promptly. UnionBudget2017-18 gave a push to market reforms in agriculture, increased funding for crop insurance and had set a higher target for farm credit by announcing a whopping Rs. 1 lakh crore increase in credit target. \xa0It was announced to increase the coverage under Fasal Bima Yojana by additional 10% of the cropped area compared to the previous fiscal. The Long Term Irrigation Fund, NABARD was announced to be augmented by 100% to improve the access to irrigation. Centre had urged the state Governments to delist perishables such as vegetables and fruits from the Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC) domain allowing the farmers to sell these commodities directly to consumers and earn a better price. Expanding the coverage of National Agricultural Market (e-NAM) was announced from 250 markets to 585 APMCs. \xa0It was announced to create dedicated micro irrigation funds and dairy processing funds. In line with the soil health card, setting up of mini labs was announced across all the Krishi Vigyan Kendras for soil testing. It als0 proposed a model law on contract farming to be shared and discussed with the states.Budget2018: Looking forwardIn an attempt to further address the farm sector distress, we look forward to seeing the following measures inBudget2018:? Private players should be incentivised to deploy modern technologies in weather/climate related predictions and forecasts which along with advanced research backed cropping pattern can help to minimise the unexpected farm losses.? To enhance productivity, a well-designed foolproof mechanism for implementation of genetically modified crops should be established.? Incentives to increase coverage of crop insurance and inviting insurance companies to develop innovative insurance products for the sector and government providing cover would be further welcome with safeguards related to claim processing.? Greater investments in storage facilities and establishment of cold chains would be another expectation from thebudgettowards reducing food wastage.? Policy measures to promote institutional arrangements such as contract farming, producers? organisations, and cooperatives that provide farmers easy access to markets, distribute price risks, and reduce marketing and transaction costs would be very welcome.? An expansion of the coverage of National Agricultural Market (e-NAM) and contract farming related announcements will be very welcome.It is very important that farm sector stress is addressed by the government earnestly as it would have a virtuous impact on the overall economy of the country as well as on the social fabric of the country.The author is Leader (Public Finance and Economics), PwC IndiaViews expressed are personal']",/budget/article/budget-2018-investments-in-agri-the-best-weapons-against-poverty-hunger-118013101024_1.html

It should focus on a comprehensive look at the health policy ?sick-care to wellness?, prevention and health promotion, financial protection, stronger partnership with the private sector and raising public health expenditure to 2.5 per cent of the GDP in a time bound manner. There has to be a concrete proposal of Universal Health Coverage (UHC) that guarantees free, cashless health services to all citizens. This is what was completely missing before in terms of healthcare as a fundamental right.UHC, in which people receive healthcare without suffering financial hardship, is an ideal that many countries in the world are successfully moving towards. Thailand has already shown the rest of the world that even with poor resources, UHC is achievable. India has agreed to achieve Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) by 2030 -- a promise made by the UPA government. It's the new minimum in global health, without which no policy orBudgetmakes sense.TheBudgetshould also make the right proposals in identifying the pitfalls of India's healthcare situation. It should acknowledge poor state spending (1% of the GDP), catastrophic expenses people suffer because 70% of their needs are met by the private sector, and how poor access to healthcare pulls down the country's development goals. It should acknowledge the need for UHC in primary, secondary as well as tertiary care because all three sectors are equally important. It should promise improved access and affordability of services through a combination of public hospitals and strategic purchasing of services from the private health sector.Budget2018 should also seek to strengthen the infrastructure, capacity, financing and human resources, and envisage a complete overhaul of primary care. The idea of primary care should include important elements that had been part of secondary or even tertiary care earlier. It should seek to harness the complementary results of the initiatives by other sectors - such as cleanliness drive, reduction of train and road accidents, and action against gender-based violence - into the newBudgetfor greater synergy.TheBudgetshould speak about a single purchaser or payer for health, which essentially means that the government would buy the healthcare services for its people, who need not worry about paying for them. The policy should promise that it would buy services mostly from public hospitals; but should also use the private players to fill in the gaps. \xa0The most crucial element this year is a strong public health infrastructure.

The corresponding ratio in countries like China, Korea and others, with which India has to compete in the global market, is over sixty per cent.The workforce is therefore woefully unproductive due mainly to the abysmal state of India?s education system, which churns out millions of adults equipped only for menial work. Its graduates go on to toil in small and micro enterprises that operate in the informal sector, which employs over 90 per cent of the entire workforce. And, we have a large pool of ?unemployable graduates?, which causes huge waste of resources.The reason for the unacceptably low quality of education or deficiency in entrepreneurial training is grossly inadequate investment in education andskills development.And, the promises made by theNarendra Modigovernment during the past four years to increase budgetary allocations and to formulate new education policy have been belied.It is unlikely that in the ensuing financial year, 2018-19, which faces the twin challenge of risingfiscal deficitand concerns about winning the forthcoming elections, funds would be made available to improve the performance and accountability responsiveness ofeducation system.Consider the following:Allocation of budgetary resources for educational development hovers around 3.7 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP). Successive Central governments, including Modi's, have made oft-repeated commitments to allocate at least six per cent of GDP, which have never been realised.Realising that the Central government was unable to fulfil the Constitutional obligation of ensuring ?universalisation of education? for children up to fourteen years due in part to paucity of financial resources, an ?education cess? has been collected since 2004 fromincome taxpayers to augment funds for investment in education. But, the funds thus collected have not been utilised.Theeducation cesscomprises two per cent ?primary education cess? and one per cent ?secondary and higher education cess?. The primaryeducation cessis used to meet part of expenditure onSarva Shiksha Abhiyan(SSA) andMid Day Meal(MDM) Schemes. The secondary and highereducation cessfunds are directly allocated through budgetary provisions.

A reasonable reduction in the existing personal tax rates would bring cheers to the taxpayers especially in the wake of rising inflation and reducing purchasing power, says the Deloitte Personal tax survey 2018.The Personal tax survey captures the views of 697 mid-level managers and attempts to gauge the mood of the taxpayers ahead of thebudget.About 55% of the respondents want the basic exemption limit to be raised from INR 250,000 to INR 500,000. Interestingly, 84% of the respondents are keen on aligning the tax year (April-March) with the calendar year (January-December).With the increasing cost of education, majority of the respondents (94%) indicated an additional deduction should be introduced towards the expenses incurred for education of children (up to two children) with a minimum limit of INR 5000 per month per child. Such a move on this front will make educational expenses more affordable for the middle-class Indian families.The Government should offer further tax rebates on home loans in order to fulfil its dream of ?Housing for All? by 2022 and to give a leg-up to the ailing realty sector. In the survey, 51% respondents said that in case of self -occupied property, deduction of interest on housing loan should be extended to at least INR 350,000from the prevailing amount of INR 200,000. Further, in case of an individual owning more than one house property, only one can be considered to be self-occupied. If the other properties are vacant, still a notional rent is offered to tax. According to the survey, 58% of the respondents opined that the concept of taxability of deemed rent on vacant properties should be discontinued. Interestingly, 29% of the respondents indicated otherwise.In line with the gradual reduction of corporate tax rates for domestic companies from 30% to 25%, most respondents are in favour of a similar reduction in the tax rates for individuals from 30% to 25%. Salaried employees are keen to see an increase in the limit for deduction under Section 80C towards certain payments and investments, currently capped at INR 150,000.The tax-free limit for medical expenses, which currently is INR 15,000 annually, was considered inadequate by all respondents. More than half the respondents (58%) are in favour of increasing the limit to INR 40,000 annually, while the remaining (42%) want to double the limit to INR 30,000.Any free meal that is provided by the employer to the employee is taxable if the value exceeds INR 50 per meal. All managers want this limit to be increased in the range of INR 100 to INR 200 per meal. Two out of every five respondents (42%) want it to be raised to INR 200 per meal, the remaining want it in the range of INR 100 to INR 150.Close to two-thirds (64%) of the respondents gave a thumbs-up to the concept of jurisdiction-free e-assessment. E-assessments are seen as part of the tax department's endeavour to expedite and simplify assessment proceedings, reduce the taxpayer's inconvenience and stamp out corruption. However, 20% of the respondents believe that this move would not be beneficial. The remaining 16% are not sure if this move would be of any help.""]",/budget/article/budget-2018-should-consider-higher-personal-tax-rebates-deloitte-survey-118013101047_1.html

Unfortunately, there are not enough institutions like we have ITIs for technical training for training professionals on insurance business. This situation will only get more acute with time unless a solution is worked on right now. I would recommend that expenditure of insurance companies on providing insurance related vocational training leading to employment be given a tax break in the form of deduction from tax payable. This will encourage more insurance companies to set up their own vocational training setups leading to greater employment and better managed growth of insurance business in India.Health InsurancePenetration of health insurance is woefully low in India. We have a strange phenomenon in India where health insurance penetration in relative terms is higher in BPL segment (due to Government sponsored schemes), middle class Government employees and in the affluent segment (due to higher awareness and ability to afford) as compared to the middle-lower middle income segments especially in the self-employed professional category in both large metros as well as small town India. While this segment may not be paying income tax , at the same time a large number of such self-employed professionals are today covered in the ambit of GST. Thus, while deductions in Income Tax may not be attractive to this segment, a set-off of GST payable could make a difference to them in terms of their cash flows and should be considered to encourage purchase of health insurance for themselves, their families as well as for their employees ? who probably are the most vulnerable and need it the most.Home InsuranceFor a large number of Indians, the biggest investment is in buying or building a home. With easier availability of mortgages and government thrust on affordable homes, Indians are not just investing their savings but also their future savings in buying or building homes. At the same time, exposure to natural calamities is only increasing with earthquakes, landslides, floods and inundation. Frequency of buildings collapsing also seems to have increased if one goes by news reports. A natural calamity in a large urban agglomeration could lead to severe losses to a very large number of home owners as less than 1% of homes in India are insured today. These losses could cause a large social upheaval and stress on Government resources as well as NPAs for mortgage lenders. There is, therefore, a crying need to increase the penetration of home insurance in India. Besides the lack of awareness, there seems to be a cultural opposition to insure homes as we believe that ?it will never happen to us?. This thinking needs to be changed and home owners need to be forced to get home insurance till it becomes an automatic part of buying/building homes in India. I would, therefore, recommend that buying home insurance be made a pre-requisite to registration of homes just like buying motor third party insurance is mandatory for registration of automobiles in India. This can start with new homes and then extended to others at the time of registration of lease agreements, changes in plans, extensions etc. Buying home insurance is a good habit and this has to be fostered forcibly to save our society from future catastrophic losses.The author is\xa0CEO & whole-time director at Liberty Videocon General Insurance']",/budget/article/budget-2018-fm-arun-jaitley-needs-to-focus-on-job-creation-insurance-118013101135_1.html

Yet the sector needs significant focus with a view to improving rural economy and livelihoods.Key Challenges1.Price Fluctuation:Farmers are frequently at the mercy of traders, inspite of good produce the price the farmers get is not sufficient to even cover the expenses. Initiatives such as Minimum Support Prices (MSPs) and Agricultural Produce Market Committees (APMCs), which were supposed to protect the farmer are not helping in good returns.2.Lack of Infrastructure:Inadequate rural infrastructure, roads & transport systems, food processing units, reliable power and cold-storage, continue to hinder farm operations and increase costs. Further, there is limited access to resources such as financial services, credit, support expertise, educational services or irrigation solutions.3.Existing crop insurance do not benefit farmers:Insurance schemes are seen as an added burden over and above the loans the farmers are already struggling to pay. Less than 20% of farmers in India are covered under crop insurance.4.Poor performance of farm exports- The country is being denied market access in the name of health and safety regulations. Prohibitive import duties and high subsidies are constraining India?s farm exports. Measures have to be taken to incentivize India competitive agro products and removal of non-tariff barrier.5.Lack of technological advances:Farmers do not have access to quick soil testing methods to know micronutrients in the soil. \xa0Other challenges are poor access to market information for forecasting, weather, price & yield at the time of sowing.Budget2018 ExpectationsAgro reforms are the need of the day. To start with, the upcomingbudgetshould encourage Corporate-Farming to protect farmers from price risks. The government should strengthen recently drafted model contract farming act and encourage states to adopt it as per their needs.Small farmers usually do not benefit from the government assured Minimum Support Prices (MSPs) as they do not have enough marketable surpluses to justify the cost of transporting the crop to government corporations in the towns. Thereby, selling it to traders at rock-bottom prices. Even, Agricultural Produce Market Committees? (APMCs) monopoly has led to cartels of traders, commission agents and transporters being formed which have not benefited the farmers so far.Further, the existing crop insurance schemes have not provided any relief to the hapless farmers. The government needs to bring in more transparency in the term and conditions of the schemes, some of which are downright absurd. In addition, given the lower penetration of the crop insurance, more geography and more crops are to be covered under existing schemes.In addition, waiving farm loans has short-term relief to a limited section of the farmer and a costly option for the banking system. Instead, the government should spend a similar amount on the improvement of agriculture infrastructure which has a much larger multiplier effect on the economy in the long run.Lastly, the agro-research should get more funding. Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) has lost its glory over a period of time. The government should apply a mission mode approach to research for achieving the goal of doubling farmer?s income by the year 2022.Dairy IndustryMilk has highest value in Indian agri and food sector, more than combined value of wheat and rice. Milk contributes close to the 1/3rdof gross income of rural households. The livestock sector contributes to 4% of India?s GDP and the dairy sector comprises majority of share.Key Challenges1.Quality a big concern? More than 70% of marketable surplus goes through informal channel where quality is a big concern. Sometimes quality is an issue in the formal channel as well. Quality of milk or value-added products are a barrier to entry to the export market, especially the USA and the EU.2.Poor governance of cooperatives- Prices decided by cooperatives are not based on fat measurement, which affects Farmer?s profitability. In addition, lower prices declared by cooperatives, results in low prices of milk paid by all the players in the industry.3.Non-existent of extension facilities:Lack of adequate breeding and preventive care services to improve animal health, along with low access to credit and risk-taking ability makes farmers unable to increase their herd size.4.Taxation on value added products:Taxation on value added products would cause the industry to reduce the milk prices paid to the dairy farmers. High rate might also increase the consumer prices of dairy products substantially.BudgetExpectationsMilk is highly perishable, therefore value addition such as processing, packaging, and conversion to long life products, such as sterilized milks (UHT), dahi, paneer, chhachh, lassi, shrikhand and so on, is more a necessity than a luxury. It is crucial that a softer view is taken while imposing GST and imperative to create special class for dairy products with minimum value-addition.The government should have a farmer-centric approach, as perhaps milk is the only industry that is able to pay to the dairy farmers more than 2/3 of price charged to the consumer. No other food processing industry in India is able to meet such high expectations of the farmers. Tax exemption on dairy industry should not be considered as a loss to the national exchequer but an investment that would spur growth in milk production, which eventually would enhance rural prosperity and increase the farmer?s income.In addition, there should be level playing field for private players and the cooperatives.

The social status ascribed to him by birth did not allow him to study with the privileged in the social hierarchy. 2500 years hence, and 70 years after independence, elementary education in India is still deeply segregated. A majority of children from socio-economically disadvantaged families attend government schools while children from more privileged families attend high or middle income private schools. Besides depriving children of the well documented benefits of diverse classrooms, this segregation has a direct correlation to the nature of profession that these children take up as adults. Section 12 (1) (c) of the Right to Education(RTE) Act, 2009, also known as the RTE 25% provides for the creation of inclusive classrooms by mandating private unaided and specified category schools to admit in class I, to the extent of at least 25% of the strength of that class, children belonging to socio-economically disadvantaged families and provide free and compulsory elementary education till 8th grade.The spirit of the law asserts the right of children to study in the school of their choice irrespective of their socio-economic background. Since its enactment, the provision has been one of the most vigorously debated aspects of RTE with its validity being asserted by the Supreme Court of India, High Courts of various States and by the T.S.R Subramanian Committee formed by the Ministry of Human Resource Development(MHRD). Therefore, as a nation we are well past the debate on the validity of this provision and are now in a stage wherein we need to find solutions to the advanced administrative impediments arising on account of the implementation of this policy.Each year, more than 2 million children stand to benefit from this provision. In its reply to anunstarred question in the recently concluded winter session of the Parliament, the government stated that in the year 2016-17, close to 3 million children were enrolled under RTE 25% admissions policy. The policy is at a different stage of evolution in different parts of the country. The States and Union Territories(UTs) could broadly be categorised to be in two categories vis-a-vis the implementation of this provision. The first category comprises of states who have either not notified the policy or have not made enough efforts to implement it in right earnest. The second category consists of those states who are striving towards the implementation of the provision in letter and spirit, have met reasonable success and are now grappling with higher order issues like those of student retention and reimbursement management. For the first category States and UTs, what is needed is administrative and political will to adopt best practices from the several years of experience of States in the second category and leapfrog to a more advanced stage of implementation. The biggest challenge faced by the second category schools is with respect to reimbursements from the government.The RTE Act states that schools admitting children under this provision ?shall be reimbursedexpenditure so incurred by it to the extent of per-child-expenditure incurred by the State, or the actual amount charged from the child, whichever is less, in such manner as may be prescribed.? Over the past 3 years, thebudgetallocations for SSA by the Government of India remains far below the resource estimates submitted by MHRD to the Government of India(GoI). SSA received only 22,015 crore (revised estimates) in FY 2015-16 as opposed to a demand of 50,000 crore by MHRD and 22,500 crore (RE) in FY 2016-17 for a demand of'55,000 crore.Additionally, GOI allocations for Sarva Shikha Abhiyaan as a share of total MHRD allocations has been constantly decreasing, reducing from 33% of MHRD allocations in FY 2015-16 to 31% in FY 2016-17 and 29% in FY 2017-18. These inconsistencies have a direct bearing on the implementation of Section 12 (1) (c). According to the numbers provided by the government in the Parliament, from 2014-2017, 7.16 million children have been enrolled under the RTE 25% provision. Assuming a 10% drop out rate, and a conservative average per child cost of Rs.5,000, the outlay for the year 2016-17 should have been at least Rs. 3,220 cr. However, only 510 cr was actually approved, leading to a 6 fold deficit. Clearly, there is a need to increasebudgetallocations made to the MHRD under SSA.With MHRD already allocating less that what States demand for, and GoI allocating less than what MHRD asks for, the shortage is compounded. Therefore, there is an urgent need to increase the budgetary allocations under SSA if the States are to reimburse schools who are admitting children under this provision. Non receipt of reimbursement could potentially result in further reduction of school participation rates and even states backing out from implementing this provision as recently indicated by the stateof Uttarakhand.There are more micro level issues vis a vis reimbursements that needs urgent resolutions. For instance, the per child cost calculated by States takes into account only recurring costs and not the costs associated with fixed capital assets. This leads to reimbursements amounts which are much less than what schools actually spend on each child. Also, costs incurred by a parent in high and middle income private schools go much beyond tuition fees and costs associated with books and uniforms. It is here that we see an opportunity to link Corporate Social Responsibility(CSR) with the education of children from socio-economically disadvantaged families admitted under this provision. Additionally, every state is now moving towards digitising the whole RTE 25% admission process with end to end Management Information Systems(MIS) which include modules like school registration, applicant registration, online lottery, student tracking and reimbursement management which are resulting in a more transparent and cost effective implementation of the policy. There is a huge potential for IT firms to support development of these online systems through their CSR commitments.There is no denying that the implementation of this policy is fraught with challenges. However, the good news is we have proven solutions to these challenges. It would be an absolute travesty of justice if each year millions of children are deprived of access to the quality education in the school of their choice for want of appropriate budgetary allocations. It is high time we ensure that our Eklavyas and Arjuns study together in the same classroom with equitable distribution of resources to help integrate the socio-economically underprivileged children into formal education. \xa0For this, all stakeholders viz. the government, corporates and the civil society need to comes together to ensure ?collective impact? and the government needs to make its commitment to this policy unambiguously clear. The beginning of making this commitment clear is allocating requisite funds andbudget2018-19 is an excellent opportunity to get the ball rolling.The author is CEO of Indus Action""]",/budget/article/budget-2018-india-needs-to-focus-on-inclusive-education-for-development-118013101185_1.html

While the government is widely expected to overshoot the FY18 target, the math still seems workable for maintaining next year?s mark. It?s pertinent to note that it would still be among the lowest deficit levels in last three decades.On the latter, in what?s a recurring pre-budgetfear each year, there?s a possibility of the government maintaining status quo. But if it decides to address the issue, we hope it tries to revise and align taxes, not merely add yet another income source.On the spending front, notwithstanding the fact that we are just 15 months away from general elections, we expect the finance minister to be categorically pragmatic, focused on asset creation andeconomyboosting spends like infrastructure and on rejecting wasteful expenditure. In this context, Hon. Prime Minister?s recent media byte sounds reassuringly pro-reform, where he remarked that it?s a popular myth that the common man invariably expects freebies and sops from everybudget.Among other things, thisbudgetcould include crucial measures to make Railways more self-sufficient, stressing on generating internal resources to fund its plans and priorities.The government?s income projections have been consistently plausible in the past few years. This time we expect slightly more aggressive estimates, which the government would strive to meet through widening of tax base and imposing penalties on basis of demonetisation data and high disinvestment income. Overall, we expect a well-balancedBudget.We would also like to underline the fact that theBudgetwon?t be the sole platform for launching reforms and we could see a string of positive measures from the government during the course of the year.Notwithstanding the fact that the 2018 UnionBudgetwould be wary of the general elections in the following year, the government would not like to turn overtly populist, going by its resolve thus far and notwithstanding the spends in staple areas like public infrastructure, agriculture, affordable housing, and mass employment, especially immediately preceding the election year.Direct taxation:The government would lower corporate tax rates, especially at a time when USA is about to opt for lower rates, which underlines the need to become more competitive in offering a conducive environment to best of breed companies to set up base in India. Also, the fact remains that we squarely depend on FDI flow to fund our current account deficit. On personal income tax rates, the government would provide relief to tax payers who had to face a difficult time during the demonetization disruption span. We can expect some extra benefit under Section 80C, apart from the raising of individual-specific tax slabs.On its tax collection estimates, the government would prefer to be slightly more aggressive than before, but of course, without losing sight of the realism that they have maintained in their estimates till date. We could well see a higher tax income collection target, more so in the expectation of a windfall in the form of penalties post demonetization, with all the data mining in process and given the strong intent to widen the income tax base.Capital Market taxation: In the run-up to every UnionBudgetannouncement, fear of levy of long term capital gains tax (LTCG), GAAR, haunt the stock market. This year is no different, with fear of an end to the exemption of long term capital gains tax on equity investments. We reckon that the government will not like to dent the improving investor sentiment, where equity participation still remains low around 5-6% of the household savings. Having said that, it could change the long-term capital gain classification criteria from one year to two years. But in the same breath, the government must then have a serious relook at STT, abolish Dividend Distribution Tax (DDT) as also reduce GST rates on share transactions from 18 per cent to 12 per cent. We may also see plugging of some loopholes like bonus stripping.Indirect taxation:Material action may not be seen since GST is now driving most of the government intent and rates are being reviewed in reactionary fashion - as and when the government feels rates need to be hiked or lowered on specific items. Customs duty may be tweaked though to benefit certain domestic industries.We see little risk to indirect tax collection from spike in crude in last few months. Our internal assessment foresees no material rise in crude oil prices from hereon. \xa0On the issue of fuel prices itself, the government may blend methanol with petrol to the extent of 15 per cent, to lower the incidence of fuel prices on the retail audience without having to materially cut taxation at their end. This blend of course, can be achieved outside theBudgettoo, and may not necessarily feature as aBudgetmeasure. The larger point is that the government would continue to be upbeat about indirect tax collection this time round.Fiscal Deficit:Given the landmark disruptions of the year, as also the reigning corporate slowdown, we can expect FY18 to go slightly off-mark, with a slippage of 10-20 basis points. But in the larger context of what the government has achieved on the fiscal discipline front, we can easily condone the slippage. We expect the government to reiterate its commitment to fiscal consolidation by continuing to aim for 3 per cent target for FY19. This is because it would like to signal low interest rates to the market as well as live up to expectations of global rating agencies who upgraded India rating. Besides, the debt-to-GDP ratio at ~70% is on the higher side and State finances are stressed. So, there?s clearly a need for proactively ensuring discipline of the fisc.It?s pertinent to note that the proposed recapitalization bonds would be below-the-line item with no impact on the fiscal deficit, except for the interest component, which is not significant in FY19.Disinvestment programme:Apart from a push to increase non-tax revenue in the form of dividends to meet the deficit target, we expect a large disinvestment programme in FY19. Given that the government prodigiously met the target for this year, its resolve has been amply demonstrated, and hence we can expect a high figure for coming year as well. Our internal forecast is for 25% return for the Nifty and Sensex in 2018, so capital market will likely remain supportive to help government meet its target.Expenditure:Save for arresting wasteful expenditure, it would be difficult to control total expenditure in a year before elections. Areas like infrastructure and affordable housing, health care, job creation and rural development would get attention. We even see a possibility of hike in minimum wages and farmer MSPs. Overall, the government will control spend on non-Plan expenditure (although it has done away with the distinction between Plan and non-Plan). It would focus on boosting economic activity while trying to minimize revenue expenditure.Another way of saving expenditure will be to ask certain departments to increasingly fund their own capex. For instance, with Mr. Piyush Goyal at the helm (who was appreciated in his work as Power Minister), the railways may look to raise resources internally through prudent measures like sale & lease back of transmission lines and land bank monetization. So, the government can now afford to stick to last year?s railway allocations or probably allot a marginally higher sum to it.The author is partner & head of research, IIFL']",/budget/article/budget-2018-preview-pragmatism-and-poise-expected-from-fm-arun-jaitley-118013101242_1.html

Expectations and excitement run high as it will be the first post-GST and last full-yearbudgetbefore the General Elections in 2019.* We note that the 2018-19Budgetwill be presented against the backdrop of uncertainty over tax collections post implementation of the Goods & Services Tax (GST). We expect the government to revise its deficit target to 3.4% of GDP for FY18 (higher than the budgeted estimate of 3.2%) and to 3.2% of GDP for FY19 (higher than the target of 3% set last year). It means that the plan to meet the 3% deficit target will be postponed by one year (to 2019-20) for the third time.* As the current government will present its last full-yearbudgetbefore the 2019 General Elections, many in the market expect a heavier dose of populism. However, we believe that the government has limited financial resources to propose any targeted scheme for the poor. We also do not expect much relief on the tax front, except some reduction in the corporate tax rate for medium-sized companies.* From an equity market perspective, it is important to see how theBudgetis able to make a difference to the rural sector, how the government is able to carry the burden of expectations, and whether theBudgetstrikes a right balance between good economics and good politics, especially with the General Elections around the corner next year. Also, as GST-related dust is still settling down, the markets will be keenly watching fiscal deficit projections and whether the long-term fiscal consolidation path is adhered to. We do expect the government to focus on rural and capex spending to boost sentiment and revive growth further. However, given the hard-achieved gains on fiscal consolidation, flexibility to go overboard on spending is limited, in our view. Consumption pick-up (especially rural and discretionary), cyclical recovery in corporate facing banks and gradual pick-up in private capex are our key themes to play in CY18. TITAN, EMAMI, UNSP, ICICI BANK, RBL, HDFC, SHTF, PETRONET, HPCL, TATA MOTORS, M&M, L&T, JSP, BHARTI are among our top ideas.In its previous budget, the center had budgeted 12-year slowest growth of 6.6% in total spending, making it clear that fiscal policy is reaching its limits. Not surprisingly then, economic activity weakened considerably in FY18, further pressurizing the government. Following the fiscal consolidation path amid growing demand to support economic recovery is the biggest challenge for the government. An anemic ruraleconomyand a weak investment cycle add to the concerns. It would, thus, be interesting to see how the Center handles the fires that are already raging.* We will discuss four key themes in this note. First, we provide our projections of FY18 revised estimates (RE) andbudgetestimates (BE) for FY19. We believe that the deficit target of 3% of GDP will be postponed by one year for the third time to 2019-20. We expect the government to revise the deficit target to 3.4% of GDP for FY18 (higher than the budgeted estimate of 3.2%) and to 3.2% of GDP for FY19 (higher than the target of 3% set last year).* Second, we believe that capital spending of the government will be budgeted to grow ~10% in FY19, following ~7% growth in FY18.* Third, we believe that rural spending may be revised upward for FY18; however, limited financial resources will make it difficult for the government to announce a targeted scheme for the poor.* Fourth, we expect the government to continue on its commitment to reduce the corporate tax rate by lowering tax for companies with turnover of up to INR25b. Such a measure could cost the government ~INR100b. Apart from this, we do not expect the government to provide further direct/indirect tax relief.Expect FY19 fiscal deficit to be budgeted at 3.2% of GDPIn its first UnionBudgeton 10th July 2014, the current government?s roadmap for fiscal consolidation proposed to reduce fiscal deficit to 3% of GDP by 2016-17. In the following two budgets, the 3% target was postponed to 2017-18 first and then to 2018-19. However, in the 2017-18 Budget, while the target was maintained for 2018-19, it appears highly susceptible once again. Considering that the government is almost certain to miss its 2017-18budgetestimates (BE) of fiscal deficit of 3.2% of GDP, we believe that the 3% deficit target will be postponed for the third time to 2019-20. According to our calculations, fiscal deficit for FY18 could be revised higher by up to 20 basis points (bp) to 3.4% of GDP, and it could be pegged at 3.2% of GDP for FY19.In line with our deficit estimates, we believe that gross market borrowings could rise from the revised estimate of INR6.3t in FY18 to INR7t in FY19. Scheduled repayments of about INR2.1t imply net market borrowings of ~INR4.9t in FY19 ? up from INR3.9t in FY18.It, however, is also important to note that net market borrowings will be 2.6% of GDP in FY19, higher than 2.4% in FY18, but lower than the levels seen in the previous years. It also implies that market borrowings will finance ~84% of fiscal deficit in FY19, higher than in the past two years, but lower levels than in the previous years. It is obvious that one-off events such as demonetization helped the government garner more resources from non-market sources and, thus, the share of market borrowings in FY17 and FY18 was much lower.Read full report here?

Most of the Indian population lives in rural areas, but it is unfortunate to see that majority of hospitals exist in urban areas. One of the biggest challenges facing our country is the acute shortage of hospital beds in rural areas. Healthcare services are lopsided in favour of cities. A major thrust is needed to increase the number of hospital beds in rural areas to improve India?s healthcare parameters and save lives of millions of people every year.Historically, Governments have given no incentives to entrepreneurs for setting up hospitals in rural areas. Whether city or village, the construction and running costs of a hospital are largely the same, and so is GST on medical equipment. However, the affordability factor of an urban patient is several magnitudes higher compared to rural patients. It therefore makes far more sense for a healthcare entrepreneur to build hospitals in cities rather than rural areas. It is a sad situation ? while Government healthcare facilities are non-existent in rural areas, there are no incentives to build private hospitals either. Consequently, rural people are forced to live without healthcare services. Do their lives have no value?To address this issue, the upcomingBudgetneeds to offer incentives to encourage and empower healthcare entrepreneurs to build hospitals in rural areas. Three steps can be taken: a 10-year tax holiday for new hospitals in villages and rural areas; accelerated depreciation (100% in the first year itself); and zero GST for life-saving medical equipment used in setting up rural hospitals.This will ensure that growth of healthcare facilities is not focused on cities alone, but also spreads to hinterland India. Once the regulatory ecosystem favours setting up hospitals in rural areas, the challenge of healthcare access can be successfully met.The author is chairman of Meenakshi Mission Hospital & Research Centre, Madurai, Tamil Nadu']",/budget/article/budget-2018-health-care-sector-needs-sops-to-set-up-hospitals-in-villages-118013101209_1.html

The Sensex and Nifty soared to record highs after a bout of volatility at start. The IMF projected a 7.4 per cent and 7.8 per cent growth rate for India in 2018 and 2019 respectively. This makes India one of the fastest-growing country among emerging economies. All this just ahead of Prime Minister Narendra Modi?s address at a roundtable of 40 CEOs of global companies at the annual World Economic Forum where he said India means business and presented an exciting opportunity for global businesses. The outlook is a smart start. Volatility could remain ahead of the F&O adjustments on Thursday. US markets ended higher after the three-day government shutdown ended. Can Fin Homes, United Spirits, Indiabulls Housing and RBL Bank are set to report their quarterly numbers today.UnionBudgetPreview 2018-19: Pragmatism and Poise on the cardsIn the last fullbudgetbefore the 2019 general elections, capital market investors would be keen to know of the government?s stand on two critical issues: fiscal consolidation, and, tax burden on capital market investments.On the former, we expect the Finance Minister to stick to the three per cent fiscal deficit target for FY19. While the government is widely expected to overshoot the FY18 target, the math still seems workable for maintaining next year?s mark. It?s pertinent to note that it would still be among the lowest deficit levels in last three decades.On the latter, in what?s a recurring pre-budgetfear each year, there?s a possibility of the government maintaining status quo. But if it decides to address the issue, we hope it tries to revise and align taxes, not merely add yet another income source.On the spending front, notwithstanding the fact that we are just 15 months away from general elections, we expect the finance minister to be categorically pragmatic, focused on asset creation and economy boosting spends like infrastructure and on rejecting wasteful expenditure. In this context, Hon. Prime Minister?s recent media byte sounds reassuringly pro-reform, where he remarked that it?s a popular myth that the common man invariably expects freebies and sops from everybudget.Among other things, thisbudgetcould include crucial measures to make Railways more self-sufficient, stressing on generating internal resources to fund its plans and priorities.The government?s income projections have been consistently plausible in the past few years. This time we expect slightly more aggressive estimates, which the government would strive to meet through widening of tax base and imposing penalties on basis of demonetisation data and high disinvestment income. Overall, we expect a well-balancedBudget.We would also like to underline the fact that theBudgetwon?t be the sole platform for launching reforms and we could see a string of positive measures from the government during the course of the year.']",/budget/article/budget-2018-fm-arun-jaitley-expected-to-show-that-india-means-business-118013101280_1.html

In this context, we expect the government to not deviate from fiscal consolidation although the glide path is likely to be extended for FY18 and FY19 at 3.4% and 3.2% of GDP, respectively.Factors helping fiscal consolidation: Recovery in nominal GDP growth (10.5% in FY19), declining trend of primary deficit due to improved tax buoyancy as tax compliance improves from GST and its spillover effect on direct taxes, and elevated stock markets (higher disinvestments) should allow fiscal deficit to reach 3.2% in FY19. Risks to fiscal deficit ? Sharp increase in oil prices and its impact on aggregate demand, primary deficit, inflation and interest rate.FY18 fiscal slippage largely due to shortfall in revenue: Shortfall from GST collections, telecom spectrum and RBI dividend for FY18 will be made up to some extent by higher disinvestment receipts, additional dividends from RBI and expenditure cut. Extra market borrowings guidance for FY18 is marginal at Rs 200 billion.Bigger challenges to divert attention from introduction of LTCG inbudget2019: Although DMs have LTCG in some form or the other, the picture for EMs is mixed with almost full exemptions (China, Thailand, and Singapore) and partial exemptions with progressive taxation in Brazil. Although we believe LTCG in some form will be introduced eventually, given that the government is grappling with larger issues like revival of growth, job creation, rural stress etc., it is unlikely that a measure which dampens investor sentiment will be implemented inbudget2019.Equity market volatility is the lowest in last 10 pre-budgetperiods: Market volatility in the pre-budgetperiod is the lowest as compared to the past 10 budgets indicating that unless thebudgetsprings up a huge surprise in terms of a surge in fiscal deficit estimate or a regressive measure such as a retrospective LTCG regime, market volatility will remain subdued postbudget.Gross borrowing program for FY19 at Rs 6 trillion: We expect FY19 fiscal deficit to be Rs 5.9 trillion and given the redemption of government bonds worth Rs 2.1 trillion in FY19 and estimated borrowings from external financing and small savings instruments at Rs 2 trillion, the gross market borrowing will be Rs 6 trillion (Rs 3.9 trillion net borrowing) for FY19.FY19budgetto focus on boosting overall growth, job creation and alleviating rural stress with an eye on upcoming elections: We expect government to focus on measures targeted at: (a) improved allocation towards productive capital expenditure and infrastructure development including affordable housing; (b) protecting and enhancing farmer?s income; (c) improving agricultural productivity; (d) wider access to finance for marginal farmers at low interest rates; (e) social sector including health and education; (f) rural non-farm income.']",/budget/article/budget-2018-to-be-presented-amid-several-key-challenges-icici-securities-118013101360_1.html

Rural India continues to remain in distress and one expect measures to address discontent and revive sentiments.Measures to shore up revenue baseWith GST Revenues falling short of expectations one expects government to look at alternative ways to boost revenues. Imposition of Long Term Capital Gains tax on Equities will be perceived negatively by equity markets.Risk of a populist tiltWith thisbudgetbeing the last one before national elections there is a risk the government adopts a populist tilt. Given the limited fiscal space and major deterioration in the fiscal deficit may be perceived negatively.By raising the market borrowing in current fiscal, government has made a very clear statement that expenditure cut is not an option. And it seems even more unlikely in next year when the rural distress is taking centre stage ahead of general elections in 2019. So the burden of managing the fiscal math in FY19 will shift to revenue side.Direct tax collections are showing encouraging trend and will likely to remain buoyant with rising tax payers? base. But the uncertainty on indirect taxes will continue in FY19 as the GST system evolves. Our base case is that government will target fiscal deficit of 3.3% to GDP in FY19. However we cannot rule out the possibility of 3% fiscal gap projection with significantly higher disinvestment target.Although the economy is showing early signs of revival, the government will have to be mindful of the challenges emerging from the rising crude oil prices and turning inflation trajectory. Government?s fiscal plans can significantly alter the RBI?s stance over inflation and policy rates. Hence, it will be essential for the government to strike a balance between the fiscal discipline and supporting rural economy.Nilesh Shetty is Associate Fund Manager (Equity Funds) and Pankaj Pathak is Fund Manager ( Fixed Income) and Quantum AMC.']",/budget/article/budget-2018-from-rural-focus-to-corporation-tax-mf-industry-expectations-118013101355_1.html

Which path would the finance minister take? Nitasha Shankar, senior vice-president and head of research, YES Securities, lists herBudget2018-19 expectations.Considering the government?s long term vision as well as the trend set through the earlier budgets, the focus this time is expected to remain largely on housing, infrastructure and the rural economy. Thus, companies catering to these areas should be the key beneficiaries. These include the ones involved in construction, cement, building material (tiles, paints, pipes),housingfinance, fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG), consumer durables, amongst others.Within infra, areas such as housing, rural connectivity, digital connectivity, metro projects, waterways, sanitation, urban & rural infrastructure, irrigation, and rural electrification are likely to continue to be some of the focus areas, as was seen through the sharp rise in the allocation towards the same in the previousBudget.Within the real estate space, the focus is likely to be on the measures towards boosting the affordablehousingthrough various measures and schemes ? including efforts taken to liquidate inventory in the system as well as providing platforms to raise capital for builders.With the likelihood of thebudgetbeing more on the side of pro-poor, there could be incentives going in the way of the rural economy, including through a focus on job creation. Not to mention that the expectations for tax cuts and lower rates for individuals and corporate both, are high as well. All of these will have a trickledown effect on consumption, and will give a fillip to areas such as farm mechanization, fertilizer usage, auto consumption and NBFCs. These would get a further boost if the government allocates higher amounts towards crop insurance (given its importance) and special focus on rolling out direct benefit transfer (given that it has helped curb the leakage in the system considerably) quicker.The financial services area could be an interesting category to look at as well, especially if the government is looking to increase the focus on long term investing in equities though various schemes - including increasing deductions under section 80c.The author is senior vice-president and head of research, YES Securities']",/budget/article/budget-2018-tightrope-walk-for-jaitley-expect-a-focus-on-housing-infra-118013101340_1.html

The education sector is slated to get its much-needed boost with school education expected to get 14% hike compared to the last year?sbudget.The publishing industry also has big expectations from the government this year, expecting some bold moves.Focus on Infrastructure and Digitization?Digital India? was Prime Minister Narendra Modi?s flagship programme launched in 2014 with a vision to transform India into a ?digitally empowered society and knowledge economy?. It focuses on addressing the issues related to technology in the education sector.Various MNCs have leveraged this to empower students in India, offer skill development programmes, and use technology to reach out to the teachers and youth across the country. For example, Microsoft partnered with 12 state governments to build ICT skills in 8 lakh government school teachers under Project Shiksha. Similarly, Project Saksham is helping bridge the digital gap in higher education institutes, impacting 71 universities by integrating technology into classroom to increase creativity, accelerate learning, and bolster collaboration.However, the structural issues in India?s higher education system are the root cause behind the demand-supply gap in the skill market. Private institutes, which account for two-thirds of higher education in India provide the finest education in the country. However, there are huge barriers for these institutions at every level ? entry, operations, and exit.Restrictions exist on the entry of foreign universities, foreign collaboration, and foreign faculty. Though there is a 100% FDI in the education sector, the clause doesn?t come without riders. According to the FDI policy for the education sector, a foreign entity can invest 100% in India but as a not-for-profit organization. Furthermore, only section 25 companies with no foreign investment can invest in institutes. If the government provides relaxation for these bottlenecks, foreign institutes and companies will be more than willing to invest in exchange programmes, distance education, and faculty exchange programmes with the existing Indian institutes.Tax Rebates for Education LoanThe benefit for eight financial years was introduced in 2006 when the cost of education was not high. However, today, an average four-year engineering course costs INR 8 - 9 lakhs and an average medical degree costs INR 12 ? 14 lakhs. The current interest rates on education loans range from 10.5% to 13.5%. Therefore, an average borrower will most likely need more than eight years to repay the loan. The education sector, including students and parents, are also anticipating relaxation in education loan under Section 80C.Tax reliefIn March 2017, an amendment denied tax relief for higher education institutions; according to Assocham, this must be immediately withdrawn. Furthermore, the chamber has also highlighted that private universities and higher education institutions are facing serious financial challenges related to high capital requirement and non-availability of financial concessions.Higher educational institutes and private companies need enough financial aid to build capacity and solve the tax burden to be able to provide quality education in India. The chamber has additionally suggested to increase the education cess to seek higher public expenditure on education across schools, universities, and advanced institutions.Outlook for publishing sector in the coming years.The government has already slated a higherbudgetfor the education sector this year keeping in mind the concerns related to the growth of education sector. Therefore, it is anticipated that there will be necessary actions in place to provide a boost to the education sector as well as the publishing sector to improve the quality of education, increase the impact of technology, and provide necessary financial reliefs for private institutions. This will help in better foreign collaborations, better outside-in perspective, and a higher student and teacher impact in India.The author is the managing director of Pearson India']",/budget/article/budget-2018-education-sector-expects-its-much-needed-boost-from-fm-jaitley-118013101385_1.html

If the particular supply is being used in the course or furtherance of business, the taxpayers should have opportunity to avail benefit of input credit on such supply.RCM on purchases form Unregistered persons:Although government has postponed the RCM provisions till March 2018, it would be in the interest of taxpayers to remove these provisions or postpone them till people get enough understanding about provisions of law.Input Credit against CGST on pan India basis:The Input credit of CGST should not be restricted to the state where the taxpayer is registered. In the past, it was available across the country on pan-India basis; there was no link to State. Under GST, if a person is not registered in a particular state, input credit of taxes paid in such state is not allowed even if it is on account of CGST. Since CGST is being paid on account of Central Government, taxpayers should get benefit of input credit against CGST paid, irrespective of whether taxpayer is registered in a particular state or not.Reduce GST on products which are likely to benefit the economy:GST on products which will benefit from the overall development of the economy should be reduced or exempted. One such example is insurance products. Currently, life insurance penetration in India is at 3-4%. In the absence of a comprehensive social security mechanism, insurance provides the first layer of financial security and the current tax rate of 18% is making insurance costlier.Talk points for direct taxCommon ManIncrease in basic tax free income:Basic tax free income, which is at present Rs. 2.50 Lacs per annum should be increasedRelief to Salaried Class:Till year 2005, a standard deduction was available to salary class people. If this can be re-introduced, it will have a positive impact on this category of taxpayers. Apart from this an increase in medical allowance will help salaried class people. Medical is one of the necessity and cost of medical facilities have increased, therefore cap of exempt medical allowance may be increasedIncrease in deduction for NPS Contribution:To make NPS more popular and lessen the dependency on social security schemes, amount of deduction for contribution to NPS should be increased.Make tax return filing automatic for individuals:Every year, processes are going to be more and more automized. In line to this, the government can take a step further by sending pre-populated return forms to taxpayers with information from their Form 26AS and other financial transactions linked to their Aadhaar and PAN. The taxpayer should have the option of review and modify before filing. This will save time of taxpayers in filling the form.Business CommunityBoost to Research and Development:Though we are align with the intention of government to reduce corporate tax rate and eliminate all exemptions and deductions. But Research and Development (R&D) is a single area where India needs more and more innovation. An additional deduction for R & D, may continue for at least next 5 years. This will create more opportunities for make in India.Growth for Housing Sector:An increase in amount of interest deduction u/s 23 for self-occupied property (SOP) and an additional deduction to the real estate industry, may give boost to the new projects, especially low cost projects.Benefits to Start-ups:Start-ups are required to be more incentivized.

Though Health care is exempted from goods and services tax (GST), there are other sectoral issues that need to be addressed.From a Diagnostics standpoint, one has firmly supported the need for a standardised, regulated Diagnostics sector and appreciated the Government?s efforts in this direction. Estimates indicate about 1 per cent of all Diagnostic laboratories are accredited.Consequently, the Narendra Modi Government needs to earmark annual allocations for establishing an autonomous body regulating the quality of services. There is an immediate need to build better primary health care centres that would help in reducing the burden on secondary and tertiary health clinics. These primary health care centres should drive awareness programmes to tackle early disease management and reduce the cost burden as well. The nation needs to shift its focus from curative to preventive health care. Accordingly, since diagnostics pave the way and determine the choice of / initiate treatment, the diagnostics industry could be the focal point for driving health care treatment options in the country.In fact, in the National Health Policy 2017, the Government has insisted on the need to strategically invest in preventive health care measures. If the Government invests enough in the Diagnostics segment, the industry can propagate early diagnosis of diseases which in turn has the potential to improve productivity loss and / or delay to onset / eliminate the necessity for tertiary treatment.Private health care manages much of the patient burden spilling from the public health care system. This has boosted many health insurance schemes. The fact, however, is that adequate and comprehensive coverage for a range of services and diseases remains elusive. Curative and invasive interventions, such as surgeries and in-patient care, are covered by public health insurance policies. But despite non-communicable diseases being responsible for more than 50 per cent of all deaths in India, health insurance schemes seem unprepared to meet this disease burden.The absence of coverage for outpatient care and pre-existing diseases is now proving to be an impediment to a comprehensive and affordable health insurance cover. One hopes the Honourable Finance Minister, Arun Jaitley, would find some ways to address the lacuna.The author is CEO of SRL Diagnostics']",/budget/article/budget-2018-govt-must-enable-shift-from-curative-to-preventive-health-care-118013101361_1.html

Further, the government's projections on growth appear to be reasonable. Overall, the Budget was nowhere near as radical as the hype around it suggested.After the hype created aroundBudget 2018considering it was to be the last before elections in 2019, the final outcome has been fairly balanced -- with nothing really radical and with the goal being to move along the FRBM path. A higher deficit ratio of 3.5 per cent for FY18 has given scope for lowering the same to 3.3 per cent in FY19. The assumption of 11.5 per cent growth in GDP based on 7.2-7.5 per cent real GDP and four per cent inflation looks reasonable, with an upward bias in case inflation is higher.ALSO READ:Budget 2018 LIVE: Modi doesn't aim for populism, GST to save us, says FMThere have been two disappointments on the tax side. The first is that there has been nothing significant for the households in terms of tax benefits. As the government has made the increase in the number of tax assesses a scoring point last year, logically, it was expected that there could be lowering of the tax rates or increasing the tax slabs. The sops provided are very peripheral in nature. Second, the long-term equity gain tax, though expected, has shaken the market. Further, given that households have migrated to the equity market from deposits, they would have to reconsider their options. While markets revive fast, the way forward is important because a buoyant market is needed for successful disinvestment, which was a major victory last year. A large part of the success of the programme may be attributed to a robust stock market with high valuations.ALSO READ:Budget 2018: With long-term capital gains tax, free market ride is overThe Budget speech was more on the expenditure side, with higher allocations being announced for infrastructure and social services. This, again, was expected."", ""However, given that the overall size of the Budget has been increasing at the trend rate of 10 per cent, it could be interpreted as being more of such allocations moving in the right direction, albeit at the normal rate. But, reading into the finer details, some interesting points arise. First, the government actually cut its capital expenditure (capex) last year from the budgeted amount of Rs 3.09 trillion (Rs 3.09 lakh crore) to Rs 2.73 trillion (Rs 2.73 lakh crore). Which means that in case it was achieved, the fiscal deficit ratio would have been higher by around Rs 300 billion (Rs 30,000 crore), which is 3.7 per cent. The compromise was on roads and Railways by around Rs 150 billion (Rs 15,000 crore). Therefore, the higher number for FY19 would actually take the total expenditure back to the Rs 3.0-trillion (Rs 3.0-lakh crore) mark.ALSO READ:Budget 2018: How Jaitley walked the talk in this 'Jai Kisan Budget'""]",/article/economy-policy/budget-2018-after-all-the-hype-jaitley-delivers-fairly-balanced-outcome-118020100951_1.html

It?s a good stance, as agriculture and the rural economy remain the foundation for India?s overall growth story. With two of three citizens living in villages, their income and consumption patterns are indeed critical to increasing demand for industry. At the beginning of his speech, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said the Budget is focused on ""consolidation and agriculture, infrastructure and healthcare?. He has walked that talk.In his last full-year Budget before the 2019 general elections and ahead of eight state elections this year, Mr Jaitley has made a slew of farm-focused announcements, raising the minimum support price to 1.5 times the production cost for Kharif crops, a key demand of distressed farmers. He also announced what is arguably the world\'s largest government-funded healthcare scheme and free gas connection for 80 million poor families.Senior citizens will also bless Mr Jaitley as they have got a bunch of goodies: Rs 50,000 per annum exemption for medical insurance under Sec 80D, etc is a big relief.All this is fine in an election-year Budget, though the omission of anything substantial for the middle class was surprising. The standard deduction of Rs 40,000 (from around Rs 34,000 now) allowed for transport, medical reimbursement for salaried tax payers can at best be termed a token gesture. The 10 per cent tax on mutual fund dividends at the hands of the investor will hit the middle class.India Inc?s big boys will be disappointed as expectations were running high that the 25 per cent corporate tax rate will be extended to them as well. The FM, however, stopped at only those with turnover of up to Rs 2.5 billion.What came as a big surprise was the 3.5 per cent fiscal deficit for FY18, even though a fiscal slippage was expected given the adverse lingering impact of demonetisation and patchy implementation of the goods and services tax. But very few expected the 3.5 per cent figure, particularly after the government reduced its additional borrowing from Rs 50,000 crore to Rs 20,000 crore.', 'Given the imperative of establishing the Budget?s credibility, the fiscal policy should ideally have targeted a reasonable fiscal consolidation. A new glide path for deficit reduction is not going to be good for bond markets. If yields go up, interest rates paid by firms and households too will rise.Much is, however, being made out of the decision to tax capital gains exceeding Rs 1 lakh without indexation benefit. This tax was inevitable and justified. Here?s why. Assuming similar taxation norms as with other assets, a study by the Bombay Stock Exchange indicated that taxes on long-term capital gains could generate Rs 49,000 crore per annum. Even if the amount accruing from the securities transaction tax is removed, the long-term capital gains tax would still generate over Rs 40,000 crore.Also, for some strange reasons, equity gets favourable tax treatment compared to other assets. For example, profits on real estate transactions for property owned for less than two years are added to the sellers? annual income and charged at whatever income tax rate is applicable. The Budget has done well to announce a clear timeframe for the reintroduction of LTCG taxation so that there are no sudden shocks to the financial markets.Overall, it?s a fairly balanced economic document. The only concern is it looks broadly like an expenditure budget. One wonders where the additional money will come from.']",/article/opinion/budget-2018-how-jaitley-walked-the-talk-in-this-jai-kisan-budget-118020100842_1.html

When nothing much happens, nothing much needs to be said.On that reckoning, the Budget for 2018-19 will be forgotten within a week, except perhaps by those who have to pay the long term capital gains tax of 10 per cent henceforth, the enhanced surcharge on personal incomes and, possibly, the beneficiaries of the new hospitalisation insurance scheme who will look forward in hope.The political impact of this scheme will be like that of MNREGA. Its economic cost remains to be seen. The devil in insurance lies in the details and must never be underestimated.While the first ? the long term capital gains tax is fully and immediately implementable, the second may turn out to be just one more announcement that gets bogged down in the details. Ever since Indira Gandhi made the poor the focus of budgeting, this has been the central problem which no government has been able to solve.That said the government must be congratulated for not having taken the well-trodden route that previous governments have tended to take before a general election. To be sure, scores of schemes have been announced with the rural vote in mind, especially rural women.But overall the allocation to these is not very much. In any case, by the time the money becomes available for spending which would be around October, and begins to get spent, the general election will be upon us.However, the prime minister and the finance minister have given their candidates several talking points when they go campaigning. To that extent this one can be called an election Budget. Indeed, one can see large chunks of the Budget speech resurfacing in the BJP?s election manifestos.Macro balancesIf we look at the past Budgets of this government, it is clear that it regards the health of public finances in completely different way from the way the Congress did.', 'It has avoided fiscal profligacy completely. The fiscal deficits since 2014 are clear proof of this.For this Mr Modi needs to be congratulated. It has been unusual for past prime ministers to place so much importance on the need for a healthy fisc. He has recognised the fact populist Budgets don?t guarantee favourable electoral outcomes.It was Indira Gandhi who started the trend in 1970 when she herself presented the Budget before she launched her election campaign. Hopefully that ghost has been laid to rest forever.Minor tweaksThere are some eye-catching tweaks such as the reduction to 25 per cent in the tax rate for companies with turnovers up to Rs 250 crore. This, as the finance minister said, should help them invest more. Whether they will depend on the availability of credit from banks, of which as yet there isn?t much hope.The downside is that just as we have seen when companies seek to avoid the effect of labour laws, in this case also we could see fragmentation as companies create new entities to remain below the threshold turnover.The little tweaks to the disposable incomes of the middle class and senior citizens don?t amount to much. But the changes made to long term capital gains tax in respect of real estate should have some impact on the black-white proportions of second sales of houses and flats.On the customs duties side also the changes are marginal, mainly at signalling to China to rather than damaging trade with it. But after what the prime minister had said at Davos about creeping global protectionism it would have been futile to except anything much more.']",/article/opinion/budget-2018-focus-back-to-raising-revenue-spending-wisely-in-small-bits-118020100801_1.html

While this time thebudgethas turned out to be a celebratory one for President, Vice President and members of parliament as they are getting a hike in their salaries, Jaitely once again left middle class disappointed by keeping income tax slabs unchanged. While presenting thebudgetin the parliament on Thursday, Arun Jaitley announced that there will be no change in personal income tax slab for salaried employees in the current fiscal year. However, he has some good news for the salaried class, as Jaitley announced that the standard deduction of Rs 40,000 has been increased in respect of transport allowance and reimbursement of miscellaneous medical expenses.While presenting the last full UnionBudgetfrom the Narendra Modi-led NDA government before the 2019 general elections, FM Jaitely treated the members of parliament by doubling their salary amount. However, he said that this is a significant step to control the existing process of revision of salaries and payments of Members of Parliament but it seems the middle-class group is not satisfied with his move.This new policy on salaries of lawmakers will effective from April 1. In his speech, he said: ?The government is proposing changes in refixing salaries of Members of Parliament. Law will provide for automatic revision of emoluments of the MPs every 5 years indexed to inflation.""With the recently announced Union Budget, now the proposed amount will be increased by as mentioned below. Take a look:1. President: 1.50 Lakh, Current Amount. While the proposed amount is 5 Lakh.2. Vice President: 1.25 Lakh, Current Amount. While the proposed amount is 4 Lakh3. Governor: 1.10 Lakh Current and proposed amount is 3.5 LakhJaitley also proposed an inflation-linked revision of salaries of MPs in hisbudgetspeech.Since middle class has high hope this time from Arun Jaitley to get some relaxation in the current tax slab, his move of increasing hike in the salaries of the president, vice president, and governor did not go down well with them. Some of the Twitterati took to their social media network to criticise Jaitley\'s\xa0 2018-19 UnionBudget.Check out some of the reactions here:#Budget2018 @republic please arrange tv debate on salary hike of MP\'s as u were barking like dogs when @ArvindKejriwal hiked salary of Delhi MLA\'sA twitter handle goes by the name of Shitikantha Mohanty wrote: ""Dolt politicians who shout n do no work going to earn more; salaried class those who toil earn gonna less.

This is the Fate of middle class & working people in #India.Not at all good.""So after checking out such reactions from the middle-class people, it is fair enough to say that Arun Jaitley has nothing to offer to the genuine taxpayers of India, as they are still suffering from the same issue.

After feeling left out from the 2017 budget, we wondered what is in Jaitely's store this time for the media and entertainment industry.\xa0 Several Bollywood biggies last year expressed their disappointment for not even mentioning the industry in hisbudget.Needless to say, post the demonetization the entertainment industry had really gone through a tough phase. So like any other sectors, the media and entertainment industry are also eyeing for its share of positive response. With less than a few hours to go, it will be captivating to see Jaitely unfolding this year unionbudgetin the parliament.The industry had been hoping for the reduction in service tax for the better workflow. Some of the biggies like Sunil Lulla, Chairman, and Managing Director, Grey group India and Tarun Katial, CEO, Big FM among others have hoped that the upcomingbudgetwill bring some change. Subjects like Infrastructure costing, simplification of GST on the services sector, ease of doing business and keeping fiscal deficit under control are some of the major highlights they have mentioned before the unionbudgetwill be announced.From un-uniform entertainment tax to not offering subsidies to the filmmakers to shoot in different countries and states, the entertainment sector has also covered some important aspects which require some changes for sure.While earlier talking to a leading daily, CEO, Big FM, Tarun Katial has expressed his point of view and said that he is really looking forward to lowering the license fee for operating in smaller cities as far as radio is concerned. He has also shown his concern toward allocating a significant percentage of funds to the media and entertainment sector as it has been attracting a lot of attention in the young generations for employment.So have a look at the major expectation of media and entertainment sector from FM Jaitely this year.1- Relaxation in the import duty on set-top boxes:The government has recently doubled the set-top boxes import duty to 20 percent, so the industry is expecting some relief by bringing back to its earlier rate.2- To control the local bodies for imposing entertainment tax:Post the implementation of GST (Goods and Services Tax), there is a no use for other tax to be implemented on the cinema exhibitor, however various states have been still imposing additional entertainment tax, so the media and entertainment industry is hoping to get rid of the local body tax.3- Some major steps to be expected against the piracy of films:Be it Aamir Khan's Dangal,\xa0 Riteish\xa0Deshmukh's Great\xa0Grand Masti or Hrithik Roshan's Kaabil the production houses suffered a loss in generating the revenues so this year the industry people are expecting FM Jaitely to spend more on the cyber-security infractions as it will help in defeating piracy.So get ready to witness the forthcoming unionbudgetof 2018 and check out whether the Modi's government will fulfill the expectation of the media and entertainment industry or not. Well, you have to wait for few more hours, stay updated for more news regardingBudget2018.

Finance Minister Mr. Arun Jaitley will present thisbudgetbefore the parliament. The salaried individuals have high expectations from thisUnionbudgetwhich is the last one in Mr. Modi?s government. There were some financial reforms made last year like demonetization and GST. This will be abudgetpost-GST.Salaried Individuals? ExpectationsSalaried individuals haveexpectations from income tax slab\xa0in Budget 2018. They are anticipating an exemption of at least 50,000. The salaried individuals have high expectations from this 2018-2019 Union budget, which will be presented on this February 1.The basicexemption limitmay be increased from 2.5 lakhs to 3 lakhs. The media buzz says that Mr. Jaitley is likely to give this announcement to bring some relief to common man.Exemption LimitThisexemption limitincrease was expected in 2017budgetitself as the common man suffered because of demonetization. However, Mr. Jaitley preferred to make some changes in the tax slabs. He reduced the tax slab from 10% to 5% for individual assesse between income 2.5 lakhs to 5 lakhs. This reduced the tax liability of all the individuals to zero or 50% of their earlier liability.If we recollect theUnionbudgetof 2017, Mr. Jaitley made a statement that the taxation burden was more felt by the honest salaried taxpayers, who were showing their income correctly. Hence post de-monetization; there was a reasonable expectation from this class, for reduction of tax liability.Modi Effect on Income TaxKeeping all these circumstances in mind, it appears that Mr. Modi?s government is in favor of a reduction in the tax. Last Year the tax slab was reduced from 10% to 5% to taxpayers earning income between 2.5 lakhs to 5 lakhs and increased the tax slab from 10% to 20% to those earning income above 5 lakhs. The increase is straight away 10%. Keeping the inflation rate in mind, the government may decide to reduce the tax slab, for individuals to have more income on hand, which will increase the consumption of goods and will increase economic growth.Keeping the Fingers CrossedThere are also guesses that the tax slab of 20% may be raised from 5 lakhs to 7 lakhs, and for 30% tax slab the income may be raised from 10 lakhs to 12 lakhs. It is also perceived that lower the tax slab, lower the tax evasion. The government is encouraging the honest tax paying individuals by reducing the tax rates or by increasing the tax slabs. The medical reimbursement component also should be increased above 15000.The highest income group should be raised above 12 lakhs. Theexemption limitneeds to be increased according to section 80C between 2 lakhs to 3 lakhs. All the individual salary taxpayers are eagerly waiting to hear what is in store for them from this unionbudget2018-19 from Mr. Jaitley. Let?s wait for the suspense to unfold.']",/article/budget2018/union-budget-2018-change-in-i-t-slab-118020100434_1.html

Fiscal deficit likely to be higher than the estimated 3.2% of GDP in FY18 on lower growth and reducing the same will be a challenge in FY19, unless we see an increase in GDP growth.? Expect to see a roadmap for reduction in corporate tax rates and personal income tax for lower income brackets benefitting the middle class. .? Farm loan waiver/subvention a possibility as a boost to affected areas in rural India and sops for agriculture, be it in terms of supporting increased mechanisation or sops to improve farm income.? With the private capex still remaining low, government may resort to increased market borrowings going forward to fund government capex, thebudgetwill continue to focus more on public sector/government capex.? Hence, we expect to see slightly loose fiscal policy and the government may not adhere to the earlier targeted \xa0tight fiscal levels to aid growth in an election year.With elections in mind, the key theme of thisbudgetcould remain as a balancing act between improving \xa0growth managing the set fiscal targets and lower tax rates \xa0especially for the lower segments and rural benefits with sops to the massesIncrease in basic exemption limit from Rs250,000 to Rs350,000 and Rationalization of tax slabs.Increase in exemption under 80C to move up from Rs150,000 to Rs250,000Investments in instruments which fund long term infrastructure bonds to be tax exempted with limit of Rs50,000Increase in Medical expense/helath insurance expenses \xa0from Rs15,000 to Rs50,000Possible Re-introduction of standard deduction for salaried class with limit of Rs50,000 ? 100,000Interest on self occupied property limit to be increased from existing Rs200,000Interest subvention announced for house loan upto Rs1.2m \xa0at 3% and upto Rs0.9mn at 4% and upto Rs0.6mn at 6.5% \xa0to continueRoadmap for the reduction in corporate taxation as proposed in the earlier budgetIn its downward glide path on fiscal deficit FY18(BE) target of fiscal deficit of 3.2% may not be achieved. With the slow down in GDP growth, it will be a tall order to curtail the deficit under 3.2% in FY18. It will be also a challenge to \xa0curtail in FY19.Expect to see additional allocations for rural, infrastructure development, health and education in addition to PSU bank re capitalisation, may see an increase in borrowingsGovernment had budgeted Rs5.8trn of gross borrowing and Rs4.23trn of net borrowing (including additional borrowing) in FY18 and restricting to it could be a challenge.Expect to see hike in passenger fares and freight rates to compensate for the increase in crude price, meet modernization of railways.With the economic growth still below the expected lines, expect to see a shortfall in tax revenue.Corporates \xa0for a change likely to have better 2HFY18 and hence tax collection is likely to be higher \xa0than estimates.The \xa0divestment income targets seems to be too aggressive for FY18 and hence expected to see a shortfall. Cash rich PSUs may be forced to buy out shares of other PSUs to meet the governments disinvestment target.Despite a steep increase in crude oil prices in the last two months, the government has passed on the hikes to the customers. Whether this will be maintained going forward into FY19 is the big challenge? Should that not happen, an increase in deficit a real possibility.We expect to see an increased fiscal pressure in FY18 on account of an increase crude oil prices.Our \xa0GDP growth estimates for FY18 remain at 6.5% .Government has the ambitious plans of ?Make in India?, where we believe there will be more thrust towards promoting domestic industries even in areas like defence. We expect to see increased defense expenditure, sops on the farm front.Automobiles:? Restoration of incentives for R&D in the form of weighted tax reduction? Lower tariffs on components for electric vehicles? For passenger vehicles, implementation of two tax rates instead of the multiple tax rates currentlyFinancials:? Banking reforms on continued re capitalization of banks? Separate exemption for insurance in 80C, increased exemption limits for health insurance? Increase limits and tweak other caveats like income for participating \xa0in the affordable housing segment especially on classification according to Tier of cities? improvement and easing for loans to MSME/SME sector especially on MUDRA and other schemes.Cement:? Low Cost Housing sops should improve demand. No major changes in taxation expected.IT:? No major change is envisagedInfrastructure:? Expect to see increased allocations on rural spending, agriculture, roads to benefit EPC companies as public sector capex is driving growth while private sector capex is falling.? Higher budgetary support for road sector/PMGSY/PMGAY? Re introduction of infra bondsDefence? Increase in defense capex \xa0by over 15% \xa0after being stagnant for the last few yearsAgriculture:?

S. President Donald Trump urged lawmakers on Tuesday to work toward bipartisan compromises, but pushed a hard line on immigration, insisting on a border wall and other concessions fromDemocratsas part of any deal to protect the children of illegal immigrants.Trump, in his first State of the Union speech, gave no ground on the contentious issue of whether to shield young immigrants known as ?Dreamers? from deportation.Aiming to keep conservative supporters happy as he looks to November congressional elections, Trump stood by a set of principles opposed by Democrats, including the border wall with Mexico and new restrictions on how many family members that legal immigrants can bring into the United States.?Tonight, I call upon all of us to set aside our differences, to seek out common ground, and to summon the unity we need to deliver for the people we were elected to serve,? Trump said in his address.Trump used the hour-and-20-minute speech, given annually by presidents to Congress, to try to overcome doubts about his presidency at a time when he is battling a probe into his campaign?s alleged ties with Russia and suffering low job approval ratings.Trump made no mention of the federal probe into whether his campaign colluded with Russia in the 2016 presidential election, a controversy that is dogging his presidency. Trump has denied collusion and has called the probe a ?witch hunt.?The speech was short on details about Trump?s policy proposals.But his sober, measured approach was welcomed by the public. A CNN/SSRS snap poll said 48 percent of those surveyed had a ?very positive? response to the speech and 22 percent ?somewhat positive.?There was little sign of unity inside the House of Representatives chamber where Trump spoke. Republican lawmakers cheered wildly at the president?s applause lines.Democratsoften sat in their seats silently and many booed when he laid out his immigration proposals.DENOUNCESNORTH KOREANLEADERSHIPTurning to foreign policy late in the speech, Trump denounced the ?depraved character? of North Korea?s leadership and said Pyongyang?s ?reckless pursuit of nuclear missiles could very soon threaten our homeland.??We are waging a campaign of maximum pressure to prevent that from happening,? he said. In a surprise moment, he singled out a North Korea defector in the crowd, Ji Seong-ho, as an example of what he called the reclusive country?s brutal nature.Trump also said he had signed an order to keep open the U. S. military prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, for foreign terrorism suspects. Former Democratic President Barack Obama had vowed to close the prison, which has been condemned by human rights groups, but was unable to shut it down completely.Whether Trump would follow through on his appeal for bipartisan harmony was far from clear. Trump?s past attempts at a unifying message have been undermined by his later rancorous tweets and divisive statements that angeredDemocratsand frequently annoyed lawmakers in his own Republican Party.The unity plea will first be put to the test in his drive for a compromise on protecting 1.8 million Dreamers - people brought illegally to the country as children - who face a March 5 deadline on whether they can begin to be deported.Republicans welcomed Trump?s immigration proposals, with U.', 'S.

These are variously called ?dream? or ?nightmare? budgets, usually depending on which side you are on, in thegovernmentor the opposition. It would be reasonable to say, however, that the NDA government?s final fullbudgetin this term is a ?restless?budget.We prefer restless, because ?rattled? is too strong a description yet, although it is thebudgetput together by a worried, impatientgovernmentnot as sure of a second term with a clear majority as might have been six months earlier.The Gujarat election was a shock, the traction Rahul Gandhi has been getting since his latest return to active politics is a cause for concern, the latest India Today Mood of the Nation poll has shown for the first time that the BJP is still the front-runner to lead the next coalition but is unlikely to have a majority of its own.That isn?t whatNarendra Modiwould be satisfied with. His style and method leave very little scope for leading a real coalition where the allies can make demands and, if not given what they want, threaten to walk out. Some of the existing allies, Akali Dal, Shiv Sena and Telugu Desam Party are vocally impatient, and Nitish Kumar can be trusted to always end up with the (likely) winning sided.Narendra Modineeds his 272. Any less, and he will be half the prime minister he has been in this term. He will not accept that.Does thisbudgethelp him turn the tide? It is difficult to see how. You cannot change the mood of farmers in two crop seasons?there?s just one kharif and rabi left before May 2019 now. You cannot roll out a hospitalisation insurance scheme of the dimensions thebudgetjust unveiled. You can?t make rural India suddenly feel so much better with Rs 1 trillion in a year. You cannot even set up those two defence manufacturing corridors in a year. Many of these ideas should have come in the government?s first year.Urban voters, on the other hand, have mostly bad news in thebudget.Like governments in the past, this one has also squeezed the same tax-payers. Cess has gone higher, a long-term capital gains tax has come above the securities transaction tax which was imposed on the promise that it was neat and simple and long-term capital gains tax won?t be needed any more.The best thing about thebudgetis that however unspectacular it may be on the ?dream? side, it isn?t irresponsible as an unexpectedly stressedgovernmentin its last year may have been tempted to present, spilling over with freebies and populism. It is, by and large, a responsiblebudget.Truly bad, but potentially popular ideas, which could have been used to fire the imagination of the poor again by seeming to hurt the rich, as demonetisation was, have been avoided. The worst of these, floating in the ?hawa?, was the return of the inheritance tax. It is possible that the Modigovernmentrealised that it couldn?t afford to give the economy a third shock (after demonetisation and GST) and that too without preparing it for it.It hasn?t come at least this year, but don?t be surprised if it pops up as an election promise. Remember, in our political system, nobody can stop a bad idea whose time has come. But at least for this financial year, and may be next, we have escaped that calamity.']",/budget/article/budget-2018-imprints-of-a-govt-unsure-of-second-term-with-clear-majority-118020101947_1.html

There are also no checks on whether suchtrustsor institutions follow the provisions on deduction of tax at source. This has led to lack of an audit trail for verification of application of income. In order to encourage a less-cash economy and to reduce generation and circulation of black money, it is proposed to insert a new explanation,? said theBudget.The Finance Bill also seeks to rationalise tax provisions relating to prosecution for failing to furnish I-T returns. The exemption given to wilful defaulters would not be applicable on shell companies. Under Section 276CC, if a person fails to furnish tax returns on time, he can be imprisoned for up to seven years and fined. However, the action cannot be taken if the person pays tax on the total income determined on regular assessment (if tax deducted at source does not exceed Rs 3,000 after reduction in advance tax). However, shell companies or companies holding benami properties are not to be given this leeway.Further, theBudgetseeks to put restrictions on the scope for adjustment while processing tax returns.

In fact, the Budget this year once again highlights the government?s complete lack of vision as far as ensuring ?Health for All? is concerned. Thefinance minister?s speechmentions two main interventions ? health and wellness centres that ?will bring healthcare system closer to the homes of people? and ?a flagship National Health Protection Scheme to cover over ten crore poor and vulnerable families (approximately 500 million beneficiaries) providing coverage up to five lakh rupees per family per year for secondary and tertiary care hospitalisation?.', 'The second aspect has made headlines today as being something ?revolutionary? in healthcare. Neither of these is a new initiative, nor are these likely to improve access to healthcare or reduceout-of-pocket expenditure.', 'Big push for the private sector?', 'Given the noise that is being made around how much of a boost the health sector has been given, one?s led into believing that there is a major increase in theBudget.On the contrary, the allocation for the Department of Health and Family Welfare for 2018-19 is Rs 528 billion, an increase of about 2.5% from the revised estimate for 2017-18 ? Rs 515.50 billion.', 'Therefore, in real terms and as a percentage of GDP, there is a decline in the healthbudgetthis year.', 'To achieve 1.5 lakh health and wellness centres, the finance minister has allocated a royal sum of Rs 12 billion ?for this flagship programme?. This comes to Rs 80,000 per sub-centre ? not enough to fill the gaps. Moreover, this is not a new initiative, as it featured in the 2017Budgetspeech as well. There have been no reports on the experience from this in the previous year, neither is it clear what this actually means.', 'Currently, sub-centres suffer from poor infrastructure, under-staffing and lack of equipment and medicines. According to the rural health statistics released by the health ministry, of the 1,56,231 sub-centres, only 17,204 (11%) met the Indian Public Health Standards as onMarch 31, 2017. About 20% of the sub-centres do not even have regular water supply and 23% are without electricity. Over 6,000 sub-centres do not have an ANM/health worker (female) and almost one lakh centres do not have a health worker (male). There are 4,243 centres without either. One can safely assume that for a sub-centre to become a health and wellness centre, the least that could be expected is that these basic facilities and human resources are provided. It is hard to understand how this can be done with the meagre funds that have been allocated.', 'Now, coming to the second announcement, which is the ?world?s largest government-funded healthcare programme?. Here as well it should be remembered that in theBudgetspeech of 2016 ? by the same finance minister ? a similar claim had been made. In 2016, it was announced that the ?the government will launch a new health protection scheme which will provide health cover up to rupees one lakh per family?. Two years on, the Rashtriya Swasthya Bima Yojana (RSBY) cover remains at Rs 30,000 a year with the promise that this will now be increased to Rs 500,000. The amount allocated for the RSBY in 2016-17, to give a cover of Rs 100,000 for one-third of the population, was Rs 15 billion.', 'This never took off and less than Rs 5 billion was spent. Last year, too, theBudgetwas revised to less than 50% of what was initially estimated. The allocation this year sees a small increase to Rs 20 billion. These figures put the credibility of these announcements themselves under doubt.On the other side, theBudgetalso announces a change from 3% education cess to 4% ?health and education cess?, and it is estimated that this would bring in an additional Rs 11,000 crore. Even if we expect 25% of this additional amount to come to the health sector, we should have seen an increase of Rs 2,750 crore in the healthbudget.Rather, there has been an increase of only Rs 1,250 crore this year. What thisBudgetseems to be doing, therefore, is raise additional revenues from common people in the name of health expenditure for the poor, while enabling higher profits for the private healthcare sector. In this context, the surge in the share prices of healthcare and insurance companies is quite telling with regard to who the real beneficiaries of this scheme will be.', 'Healthcare for the poor or profits for the corporates?', 'Experiences from across the world show that depending upon the private sector to deliver healthcare for all ? based on health insurance to take care of the burden of out of pocket health expenditure ? escalates overall healthcare costs, excludes many and distorts practices of ethical and appropriate care.Even when this government attempts to do anything for the health of people, it hopes to do this through the private sector and not by strengthening the public health system.', 'We also have enough evidence from India to show that an insurance-based strategy does not effectively address this problem of out-of-pocket expenditure. Most independentevaluationsof theRSBYshow that this scheme has neither managed to significantlyreduceout-of-pocket expenditure nor has it increased access to healthcare for the poor. The RSBY or even the new National Health Protection Scheme provides a cover for only in-patient treatment. For primary care, the strategy is to depend on public services which are currently inadequate and need more resources. This does not address the main issue of out-of-pocket expenditure as in India, 67% of all expenditure on health is out-of-pocket and of this, 63% is on out-patient expenditure.', 'Further, as mentioned in a previous columnhere, despite a decade of promoting insurance-based schemes, such as the RSBY (and also state schemes such as Aarogyasri in Andhra Pradesh), the data from the National Sample Survey shows increasing out-of-pocket expenditure.Sundararaman and Muraleedharan,based on their analysis of NSS data for 2014,show thatonly 1.2% of the hospitalisation cases of the rural population and 6.2% of the urban population received even part reimbursement. There is evidence to show that despite efforts towards pushing for increased insurance coverage, neither have the poorest been reached out to nor has there been efficient financial protection. A recent paper by Anup Karan and others also finds that, ?RSBYdid not affect the likelihood of inpatient out-of-pocket spending, the level of inpatient out of pocket spending or catastrophic inpatient spending?.', 'This focus on insurance instead of strengthening availability of public services allows the government on the one hand to get away with low allocations for health and, on the other, provides more opportunities for the private sector to make money out of poor people?s illness. Research from Chhattisgarh, which also has a state health insurance scheme along with the RSBY, shows that the accredited hospitals are highly concentrated in certain urban pockets, making it inaccessible for most of the rural poor.', 'Not UHC', 'The high burden of out-of-pocket expenditures (OoPE) on health in India has rightly been recognised by many as one of the main problems facing the people. There are a number of studies that show that catastrophic expenditures in health is the topmost reason for pushing people into poverty (7%of the populationfell belowthe poverty line due to OoPE on health).', 'By any yardstick, this new scheme is also not taking us towards universal health coverage (UHC). UHC by definition means universal coverage for all medical expenses ? this health insurance scheme covers only a part of the population (ten crore households i.e. about 40% of population) for in-patient care alone.', 'There are also a large number of academic articles, recommendations of government committees, the National Health Policy and so on which state that the expenditure on healthcare in India needs to beincreasedto at least 2.5 ? 3% of the GDP. Yet, year afteryear,we remain at around 1%-1.2% of the GDP. The headlines have got it wrong ? thisBudgetis not about the world?s largest health protection plan ? rather, it is about the country with the highest number of child and maternal deaths in the world spending less than almost all other countries in the world ? a country where government after government has shown no commitment to the health of its citizens.', 'Dipa Sinhateaches at School of Liberal Studies, Ambedkar University, Delhi.Published by arrangement withTheWire.']",/budget/article/budget-2018-and-health-poor-will-not-be-the-true-beneficiaries-of-modicare-118020200145_1.html

Why should the retailer listen to you?', 'Begin by making it clear who you are. Start with: ?As a loyal customer??, ?As a farmer??, ?As a woman?? or ?As a dad?? and you give yourself an identity. Do you live near a polluted river that is full of discarded plastic bags? Are you a parent who volunteers in the local community and needs help? Have you been a loyal consumer for years?

Since his early years, Shaw made a name for himself by amassing bounteous runs across tournaments""]","['Led from the front by Prithvi Shaw, theunder-19 Indian cricket teambeat Australia under 19 convincingly by eight wickets in the final tie to claim the Under-19 Cricket World Cup title.Priyanshtakes a look at the skipper?s career so far and the promise he has shown, drawing a clear comparison with Virat Kohli, who too tasted success at the under-19 level.In the world of sport, seldom are sporting heroes divorced from myths and legends. They give rise to imagination, storytelling and narrative-building. Prithvi Shaw?s fledgling genius is already in the throes of heroism. When Booker Prize-winning author Aravind Adiga wroteSelection Day, the protagonist Manjunath Kumar?s cricketing journey bore a striking resemblance to that of the current India under-19 captain.On Saturday, when Shaw set out to lead the Indian side against Australia in the World Cup final at Mount Maunganui, he had another chance to burnish his already-gleaming star. And he did not disappoint as the captain of a young team. Under his captaincy, India under-19 team convincingly beat Australia by eight wickets to claim the world cup title.The batsman?s story has been marked out by an inevitable path to stardom. Since his early years, Shaw made a name for himself by amassing bounteous runs across tournaments. The prodigy?s disposition to act beyond his age on the cricket field still marks him out.Evidence of Shaw?s growing maturity was witnessed last October when he scored 66 for the Board President?s XI against New Zealand in a warm-up game. The Kiwis possessed Tim Southee and Trent Boult, two of the best seamers in international cricket, but the Mumbai boy was rather unfazed. Although he has not got a chance to exhibit the entire range of his wares at the ongoing World Cup ? such has been India?s dominance ? Shaw?s assured manner has stood out in every innings he has played. Opening the batting, his lowest score in four innings has been 29 in the final.Of course, alongside the adulation and mythmaking, comparisons follow the teenager. Shaw has been called the nextSachin Tendulkarand even Virender Sehwag-like. His relatively short frame, at five feet and seven inches, and his aggressive demeanour while batting naturally invite such comparisons. One suspects that after Shaw has led India to victory, he would be matched up with another skipper who tasted success at the under-19 level ? Virat Kohli.India boasts a rich record in the junior World Cup. Arguably, no other cricketer has translated his success at the under-19 level to senior cricket like Kohli. He continues to push the boundaries of excellence, something that is often said about Shaw as well.Once he led India to the under-19 World Cup title in 2008, it was only a matter of time before Kohli replicated his dominance at the senior level. This expectation will follow Shaw too. However, it is not an easy responsibility to bear. Just ask Unmukt Chand, who guided India to glory at the 2012 under-19 World Cup.', 'The early promise has faded somewhat, albeit there might be more to come from Chand who is still 24.However, Shaw?s record in first-class cricket gives rise to confidence in his ability. In 18 innings, he has already accumulated five centuries at a delightful average of 56.52. Wherever Shaw has played, runs have arrived aplenty. So have the rewards.From being gifted a flat by a Shiv Sena politician at the age of 11 to employment by Indian Oil last year, Shaw has already raked in the benefits his success commands. The batsman was also snapped up by MRF in 2017, who of course sponsor Virat Kohli?s willow too. There will, of course, be greater rewards in store if India remains unbeaten at the end of this under-19 World Cup.It is not, though, as if Shaw?s game exists without flaws. Bowlers in domestic cricket are aware now that his penchant to flash on the off-side makes him vulnerable. The trouble for them is that it is also the strongest aspect of his game. His dimunitive frame invites short-pitched bowling but it also helped Shaw develop the cut, one of his favourite shots. Consequently, he became a strong back foot player.Shaw?s occasional failures, though, have lent him a greater awareness of his fallibilities. This can be witnessed in a more judicial use of his strongest weapons now. Shaw?s work on his technique has underlined the savvy approach which defines his game.Of course, the step up to senior cricket will pose questions he may not have been asked yet. It is worth recalling that Kohli?s struggles with the moving ball showed him up on his first Test tour of England. While Shaw rides a wave, troughs will inevitably sneak up on him. It will be his response which will define him as a cricketer. On current evidence, Shaw seems to be well-positioned to counter the gauntlets thrown at him.However, there is one thing which separates the teenager and Kohli. Unlike the latter, Shaw is not known to wear aggression on his sleeve. His soft-spoken ways, however, transform into a brutal evisceration of the opposition when he steps out to bat. As a fellow destroyer of bowling attacks, Virat Kohli will certainly approve. Shaw?s promise awaits its crowning glory.']",/article/economy-policy/u19-cricket-world-cup-prithvi-shaw-acts-beyond-his-age-india-wins-title-118020300378_1.html

His competitors traveled with whole retinues of mechanics, psychologists, sponsors and chaperones; Keshavan didn?t even have a coach. Now he finally has a state-of-the-art sled. But on Dec. 8, just before he was supposed to compete in a World Cup contest in Calgary ? a race he needed to complete in order to secure his spot in the Pyeongchang Games ? his sled runners cracked beyond repair.At the last minute, he borrowed a set of runners (the blades that curve up like ram?s horns from below the luge) from Daria Obratov, a Croatian pilot. The runners were entirely the wrong size, and he didn?t have time to try them before racing. But for Keshavan, this barely qualified as an impediment. It was no crazier than the time four years ago when he fell off his sled midrace and, without noticeably slowing down, got back on; it was no harder than 12 years ago, when he ran out of funds and couldn?t compete for two seasons. In Calgary, he scored the point that would help him get to this year?s Olympics. It will be his sixth and probably his last. But he?s willing to play it by ear.?This is the Red Demon!? Keshavan said, introducing his sled. Cheerfully handsome ? square jaw, long hair, bold eyebrows ? Keshavan, 36, is equally easygoing and alert. It was Dec. 11, and we were in the obsessively tidy workshop of the sled builder Duncan Kennedy in Lake Placid, N. Y. They had three days to get the Red Demon?s runners ready in time for another do-or-die World Cup.In his racing days, Kennedy was one of the best pilots on the United States luge team. After retiring, he was its technical director, but four years ago, he and the team had a ?bad divorce? after the Sochi Games. Kennedy met Keshavan just as he was looking for a new job, and he agreed to be Keshavan?s coach ? the first individual coach Keshavan had ever had, after 18 years of competition ? and to build him his first-ever custom-fitted sled.?Some of the materials we use, they?re built for speed, not durability,? Kennedy said, by way of explaining the malfunction of Keshavan?s sled in Calgary. ?And this stuff sucks as far as durability.? But a sled he designed, he noted, won the bronze in Sochi.To many ears, the word ?India? paired with ?sledding? sounds oxymoronic, but Keshavan grew up in the Himalayas, in a mountainside village in the far northern state of Himachal Pradesh. He guesses that he was 3 the first time he skied, on homemade wooden runners. And he even tried luge ? but in the summertime, using a homemade sled outfitted with wheels, zipping downhill on mountain roads. (?There have been mishaps,? he says. ?The worst is the potholes.?) His parents seem to have been as freewheeling as he: His mother is from Italy, his father from the southern Indian state Kerala, and they met while backpacking in the Himalayas in the late ?70s. In 1996, the year Keshavan turned 15, he had a reputation as a skilled skier but had no specific ambition. Then the Austrian luge champ Günther Lemmerer came to Keshavan?s school to scout for the International Luge Federation.Luge is one of three Olympic sledsports(it?s the one in which the racer lies fully exposed, faceup and feet first) and it has always been dominated by Germany, Austria and Italy. But if the sport was to remain in the Olympics, it needed to field athletes from more countries, so Lemmerer was searching for them all over the warmer world. He picked Keshavan to join a luge training camp, which began with a film screening of Olympic luge highlights, complete with dramatic crashes, followed by ?Cool Runnings,? the 1993 Disney movie about the Jamaican bobsled team. ?I was very inspired by it,? Keshavan says. The next year Lemmerer took him to his first race, in Austria. Keshavan promptly broke his foot ? and scored a good-enough time that Lemmerer thought he could qualify for the Olympics the following year. And then there he was, all alone in Nagano, Japan, the only Indian in the 1998 Games, the only Indian ever to qualify for luge and, at 16, the youngest luge Olympian in history.Four years later, the Italian luge team offered Keshavan full use of its world-class coaches and facilities, an off-season job in the Italian police and eventual citizenship if he agreed to compete under their flag. Keshavan never even considered it. ?For me the dream was to get the Olympics to my hometown,? he says. ?And that was the only reason I was doing it. To show that we are also here.? Keshavan has never won a medal in theWinter Olympics? no Indian has. But he is the reigning Asian champion of the sport, winner of 10 Asia Cup medals and holder of the Asian speed record (83.5 miles per hour). When he went home to India after winning his first gold in the Asia Cup in 2005, ?the entire town had a holiday,? he says. ?They all carried me along the main street, throwing flowers.?In theory, theWinter Olympicsis a global event. But winter is not a meaningful seasonal category for nearly half the world?s countries. And nearly half of the countries of the world have never competed in the Winter Games. Of the 22 Winter Olympics, India has sent athletes to only nine, at two of them represented by a team consisting only ofShiva Keshavan.Without institutional support, Winter Olympians from the so-called smaller nations have to hustle year-round just to train. This year, one Jamaican bobsledder is literally having a bake sale, peddling banana bread to raise funds. In the off-season, Keshavan works as a waiter and pizza chef in the Italian restaurant his parents run near their Himalayan town. He has had few sponsors, and only since 2008, when Coca-Cola first paid him to carry around a branded bottle for the season. Otherwise, like many of his equatorial peers, he crowdfunds online. ?It?s awkward,? he says. ?But it has to be done.?I asked him what sort of support he gets from the Indian Olympic Association, and he practically did a spit take. ?In 20 years, the Indian Olympic Association hasn?t given me a dime,? he said, laughing. Two months ago he emptied his bank account and maxed out his credit card to keep touring, continuing only because the Indian government?s ministry ofsportsagreed at the last minute to cover $8,000 of his debt. He had been fruitlessly petitioning them for help for five years. Once, he said, ?they actually asked me to get a certificate to prove thatWinter Olympicsis on par with Summer Olympics.?India, the second-most-populous country in the world, is the absolute worst at the Olympics in general, with the lowest number of medals per capita. Indian Olympic officials sometimes seem determined to embarrass their country?s athletes. Two years before the 2014 Games, the Indian Olympic Association was suspended from the Games over a corruption controversy, and Keshavan had to walk in the opening ceremony as an ?Independent Olympic Participant.??There used to be some ridiculous stories in the newspaper like, ?We are genetically not sporty,? ? Keshavan says. ?But anybody can do it. I think you can literally pick anybody with some aptitude from the street, and within eight to 10 years you can turn them into a world-class athlete. But still we don?t have that mentality in India.? Indiansportsofficials, he says, ?want you to first win something on your own. They actually tell me, You win an Olympic medal, then we will start. At that point I won?t need any funding! But that?s the way it?s been: In India the people who have brought attention to any sport have been individuals who have gone on their own lone journey.?The Indian novelist Amitava Kumar has written beautifully about the agony and ecstasy of being an Indian Olympics fan, so I called him to ask about Keshavan. In part, Kumar?s love of India at the Olympics seems akin to that of a Chicago Cubs fan before 2016: an almost masochistic revel in the heart-rending pathos of the seemingly permanent underdog (a sentiment that Bollywoodsportsfilms, he noted, exploit to the maximum). But it?s also a desire to recognize the genuine achievement even of those who never medal.', 'He raved about Dipa Karmakar, who became the first female Indian Olympian gymnast despite having only minimal gymnastics facilities in her hometown, and who is known for performing a vault so dangerous that American Olympians refuse to attempt it. And he recalled watching the silver-winning performance in women?s badminton of P. V. Sindhu as ?an extraordinary experience ? not least because my daughter said, ?Dad, I?d love to play badminton.? My God. Look at what a transformative, electric effect P. V. Sindhu has on other Indians ? especially other Indian women.?']",/article/current-affairs/the-lonely-mission-of-indian-who-plays-most-dangerous-winter-sport-118020300517_1.html

Now, the model is cracking.Kobe Steel Ltd.,MitsubishiMaterials Corp. andSubaruCorp. have all admitted in recent months to manipulating quality inspections, though all say no safety problems emerged.TakataCorp. declared bankruptcy last year after admitting to supplying more than 50 million defective vehicle air bags in the USMitsubishiMotors Corp. has admitted covering up vehicle faults and falsifying fuel-economy data.NissanMotor Co. the world?s fifth-largest auto maker, disclosed in September that its Japanese factories let unqualified employees perform final quality inspections on some cars, a practice that might date back to the 1990s. During audits, foremen routinely provided trainees with badges from certified inspectors, the company said.Because results from new-car inspections are recorded on paper and stored in binders, it was nearly impossible to determine how many cars were affected, according to one person familiar with the process.Nissanrecalled 1.2 million vehicles in Japan?nearly every one it produced in the three years through September. It says safety was never compromised.Corporate wrongdoing occurs the world over, but Japan?s scandals cut to the core of what has kept Japanese brands popular, as well as the country?s perception of itself. Japanese brands, once a byword for quality, score well on many quality surveys, but American car makers have bested them in the past two years in J D Power?s Initial Quality Study, and makers of other products are also catching up.The scandals threaten to accelerate an erosion of Japan?s global market share for manufactured goods, handing main rival China further momentum in its march toward becoming the world?s largest economy. They also call into question one of the world?s most influential theories of management andmanufacturing.Japan?s model, celebrated in publications such as Harvard Business Review, hinges largely on the concept of kaizen, often translated as ?continuous improvement.? In practice, it means eliminating unnecessary activity, reducing excess inventory and using teamwork to fix problems when they arise.It places enormous responsibility on line workers at the factory-floor level, known as the genba, to manage daily operations and generate innovation. Those workers, viewed by many Japanese as craftsmen, have traditionally been guaranteed jobs for life in return for dedication to their company?s goals.In one oft-cited example, individual workers at Toyota Motor Corp. were given authority to pull a cord to stop the assembly line whenever they spotted a serious problem. Errant screws or tools on the factory floor were seen as major lapses in discipline, and corrected.The problem today is that many Japanesecompaniescan no longer afford the luxury of guaranteed lifetime employment for craftsmen on factory floors. And delegating so much authority to line workers has leftcompaniesexposed to fraud and corner-cutting, while giving executives room to shirk responsibility, according to management consultants and corporate lawyers knowledgeable about the problems.?The genba has been broken,? says Hideaki Kubori, aTokyolawyer experienced in handling corporate scandals. The inability ofcompaniesto fully control it has resulted in a ?kind of crisis? for Japanese industry, he says.Kobe Steel, based near Osaka, makes high-end steel products for trains, cars and rockets. It recently admitted to faking quality-certification documents for hundreds of thousands of products for more than 500 clients.An internal company report completed in October found that line workers were overworked as the company tried to maintain profitability, and executives were out of touch with the factory floor.Problems intensified during busy periods, says Takashi Ueda, a 24-year-old who works for a Kobe Steel subcontractor and makes final quality checks on wire used in car engine springs. When delivery pressure was tight, he says, Kobe Steel employees approved products he told them might fail to meet required standards. ?There are occasions when we are forced to prioritize a quick shipment over quality,? he says.One Kobe Steel employee who has worked for the company for three decades, as a factory manager and at headquarters, says pressure started to build on the genba after Japan?s bubble economy burst in the early 1990s.Quality-checking staffers became some of the first targets of layoffs because they didn?t appear as busy as production-line workers, he says. Line workers were told to make quality checks themselves, he says, and some checks were outsourced after the company suspended hiring.Workers involved in data falsification felt they had no choice because they needed to keep production moving, he says, and customers with urgent orders sometimes accepted products that didn?t meet specifications.Kobe Steel said in a written statement that pressure from management to achieve profits and meet production deadlines was one of the root causes of misconduct. The company said it has commissioned an independent investigation to provide recommendations for reform.Kobe Steel acknowledged in a November report that a ?closed culture??one in which factory workers dealt with problems themselves, often without senior executives in the loop?contributed to its scandal.

This author discusses what investors should do right now.Last Friday, the combined market cap of all BSE-listed companies fell by Rs 4.6 trillion to Rs 148.54 trillion from Rs 153.1 trillion on Thursday. In a matter of just eight trading days, the market cap of BSE stocks fell by over Rs 8 trillion from the peak value of Rs 156.56 trillion. This massive fall was mainly due to a very fast and large buildup in the base of the overall market cap in the last one year.From Budget 2017, the BSE added an incremental market cap of around Rs 42 trillion as on January 23, 2018. Hence, this crash was waiting to happen and the imposition of long-term capital gain tax became the excuse.The year 2018 is set to witness several uncertainties or unfavourable developments ? recent steep recovery inoil pricesand also firming up of prices of many metals and resources would apply pressures on the corporate margins and also on the country?s import bill. Interest rates are likely to tighten consequent to spurt in imported inflation and also recent Budget proposal to hike minimum support prices for the farmers. For the last two years, we had a near-normal monsoon. Once in 3 or 4 years, we had a major failure of monsoon in the last few decades. Therefore, if rainfall forecast (expected in a couple of months) projects dismal performance this year, then inflation expectation could rise further. Fiscal deficit target is likely to be missed for FY2019 ? marginal increases in both capital receipts and effective revenue deficits as projected by the Budget are way below the actual increases in FY2018 (RE) over FY2017. Added to this is political uncertainty emanating from the assembly elections for few major states by end of this year.Don't panic, don't sell good quality stocksWhat do investors need to do now? Do not panic and sell good quality stocks (in terms of quality of management and balance sheet) provided valuation comfort is attractive. However, a large number of stocks in the small and mid-cap (SMC) space still remain over-valued ? many stocks in this space trade at over 25 to 30 times projected one-year forward earnings, which are more than 100% of their recent historical averages. Hence, as these possible risk factors/uncertainties gradually unfold, we can expect a large number of retail investors getting rid of such over-valued SMC stocks in quickest possible time.However, the medium to long-term outlook still remains very attractive for both Indian economy and equity markets. Tailwinds from the global economic cues remain highly positive."", 'Significant recovery in the GDP growth rates of the economies of US, Euro area (except the UK), Japan and Russia, and also stability in the growth rate of China (as opposed to fear of hard landing of its economy) augur well.

On the domestic front, export and banking credit growth rates have turned into double digits recently. Budget?s boost to rural spend would push up, to a considerable extent, aggregate demand in the system. Bad assets of the banks are likely to peak by March or June 2018. FDI flows remain robust and earnings from foreign tourist arrivals growing at quite an impressive rate. Also reform initiatives undertaken (GST, FDI policies, etc), massive push to rural infra, roads and regional airports, and thrust on private and public sector companies for spurring manufacturing and infrastructure investments (as the Budgetary support is projected to grow in poor single digit in FY2019) would start pushing up both economy and thestock marketseventually by end of 2018.Sensexmay rise just 5-10 percent in 2018']",/article/economy-policy/sensex-slips-over-1-000-points-in-2-sessions-what-investors-should-do-now-118020500191_1.html

He?s inheriting a U. S. economy in its third-longest expansion on record, with unemployment and inflation near historically low levels.?Global growth feels more powerfully coordinated than it has in a long time and inflation remains low,? said Carl Tannenbaum, chief economist at Northern Trust Corp. and a former Chicago Fed staffer. ?Some view inflation as a problem, but I remember when this was referred to as Goldilocks conditions.?Still, the little girl from the fairy tale eventually confronted three bears, and so too the new Fed chief likely has trouble headed his way as he tries to keep the economy from overheating or getting cold. AUSstock market that?s roared to record highs in recent months is waking up to the risks: The Dow Jones Industrial Average tumbled 666 points on Friday, the biggest drop since June 2016.It?s not just that inflation has languished below target. A deeper concern is that economists don?t completely understand why. The nation?s unemployment rate has fallen to 4.1 percent, less than half its crisis-era peak. That?s well below where most experts believed it would begin to provoke higher wages and inflation.?This is more of an existential question - do we even know what drives inflation?? said Julia Coronado, founder of research firm MacroPolicy Perspectives LLC in New York and a former Fed economist.This complicates Powell?s task in contemplating how fast to pull away from the proverbial punch bowl as the economy gains momentum. In December, the median projection from Fed officials called for three quarter-point interest rate increases in 2018, but more could be needed.On Friday, Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan said three rate hikes this year is the base case, though ?it could be more than that, we?ll have to see.? About an hour later, speaking at a different event, San Francisco Fed President John Williams sounded more like he wants to stay the course: ?I don?t see an economy that?s fundamentally shifted gear? and ?we should stick to that plan? for gradual rate hikes, he said.Global growth has picked up, jobs gains continue at a robust monthly pace, business investment has risen in recent months and Congress has just passed a set of tax cuts. On the other hand, the Fed?s preferred gauge of inflation, while creeping up to 1.7 percent in 2017, remains sluggish.?The goodnewsis inflation has been cooperating recently,? said Michelle Meyer, head ofUSeconomics at Bank of America Corp. ?But if we fail to see a further acceleration of inflation or see a deceleration, that does create a lot of problems.?Political flare-ups, particularly those expressed on Twitter, might also intervene.', 'President Donald Trump, who promoted Powell from Fed governor to succeed Janet Yellen as chairman, has made clear his affinity for low-interest rates, as well as his disdain for Washington protocol. If inflation does finally respond to the tight labor market and Powell quickens the pace of rate hikes, he may face the sharpest White House criticism aimed at the Fed since the Nixon administration.']",/article/economy-policy/jerome-powell-becomes-fed-reserve-chief-as-us-economy-begins-to-show-strain-118020500090_1.html

The tax comes into effect from April 1, 2018, the clarifications said.Here are the other responses to the frequently asked questions around long-term capital gains tax:What has been proposed, according to the I-T dept clarifications?Under the existing regime, long-term capital gains arising from the transfer of long-term capital assets, being equity shares of a company or a unit of the equity-oriented fund or a unit of a business trust, is exempt from income-tax under clause (38) of section 10 of the Act. However, transactions in such long-term capital assets are liable to securities transaction tax (STT).Consequently, this regime is inherently biased against manufacturing and has encouraged diversion of investment to financial assets. It has also led to significant erosion in the tax base resulting in revenue loss.The problem has been further compounded by the abusive use of tax arbitrage opportunities created by these exemptions.In order to minimise economic distortions and curb erosion of tax base, it is proposed to withdraw the exemption under clause (38) of section 10 and to introduce a new section 112A in the Income-tax Act, 1961 vide clause 31 of the Finance Bill, 2018, so as to provide that long-term capital gains arising from transfer of such long-term capital asset exceeding Rs 100,000 will be taxed at a concessional rate of 10 per cent.What is the meaning of long-term capital gains under the new tax regime?Long-term capital gains mean gains arising from the transfer of long-term capital asset. The Finance Bill, 2018 proposes to provide for a new long-term capital gains tax regime for the following assets:i. Equity Shares in a company listed on a recognised stock exchange;ii. Unit of an equity oriented fund; andiii. Unit of a business trust.The proposed regime applies to the above assets, if ?a. the assets are held for a minimum period of twelve months from the date of acquisition; andb. the Securities Transaction Tax (STT) is paid at the time of transfer. However, in the case of equity shares acquired after 1.10.2004, STT is required to be paid even at the time of acquisition (subject to notified exemptions).What are the modes of acquisition of equity shares which are proposed to be exempted from the condition of payment of STT?The central government had exempted certain modes of acquisition of equity shares for the purposes of clause (38) of section 10 of the Act vide notification no. 43/2017 dated 5th of June, 2017. This notification is proposed to be reiterated for the purposes of clause 31 of the Finance Bill, 2018 after its enactment.What is the point ofchargeabilityof the tax?The tax will be levied only upon transfer of the long-term capital asset on or after 1 st April 2018, as defined in clause (47) of section 2 of the Act.What is the method for calculation of long-term capital gains?The long-term capital gains will be computed by deducting the cost of acquisition from the full value of consideration on transfer of the long-term capital asset.How do we determine the cost of acquisition for assets acquired on or before 31st January 2018?The cost of acquisition for the long-term capital asset acquired on or before 31st of January, 2018 will be the actual cost. However, if the actual cost is less than the fair market value of such asset as on 31st of January, 2018, the fair market value will be deemed to be the cost of acquisition. Further, if the full value of consideration on transfer is less than the fair market value, then such full value of consideration or the actual cost, whichever is higher, will be deemed to be the cost of acquisition.How will the fair market value be determined?In case of a listed equity share or unit, the fair market value means the highest price of such share or unit quoted on a recognized stock exchange on 31st of January, 2018. However, if there is no trading on 31st January, 2018, the fair market value will be the highest price quoted on a date immediately preceding 31st of January, 2018, on which it has been traded.In the case of unlisted unit, the net asset value of such unit on 31st of January, 2018 will be the fair market value.Please provide illustrations for computing long-term capital gains in different scenarios, in the light of answers to the previous two questions 5 and 6.The computation of long-term capital gains in different scenarios is illustrated as underScenario 1:An equity share is acquired on 1st of January, 2017 at Rs. 100, its fair market value is Rs. 200 on 31st of January, 2018 and it is sold on 1st of April, 2018 at Rs. 250. As the actual cost of acquisition is less than the fair market value as on 31st of January, 2018, the fair market value of Rs. 200 will be taken as the cost of acquisition and the long-term capital gain will be Rs. 50 (Rs. 250 ? Rs. 200).Scenario 2: An equity share is acquired on 1st of January, 2017 at Rs. 100, its fair market value is Rs. 200 on 31st of January, 2018 and it is sold on 1st of April, 2018 at Rs. 150. In this case, the actual cost of acquisition is less than the fair market value as on 31st of January, 2018. However, the sale value is also less than the fair market value as on 31st of January, 2018.', 'Accordingly, the sale value of Rs. 150 will be taken as the cost of acquisition and the long-term capital gain will be NIL (Rs. 150 ? Rs. 150).']",/article/economy-policy/cbdt-says-no-inflation-adjustment-available-for-ltcg-tax-things-to-know-118020500084_1.html

This approach brings forward benefits or gains, often based on cosmetic solutions, and defers risks or costs into the future. It\'s a convenient model for many reasons. But it\'s now in danger of breaking down.Extend and pretend is predicated on financialization, especially time-value concepts that favour the near term while discounting future events. It may also be a consequence of the human predilection for immediate gratification.To adapt Thomas Hobbes, we seem to have decided that only the present is real because the past is a memory and the future has no reality.Despite the financial crisis of 2009, the world remains dependent on increasing levels of debt to bolster demand, ignoring an uncertain ability to meet future obligations. Global nonfinancial debt increased to a record $175 trillion in the third quarter of 2017, equivalent to 238 percent of global gross domestic product (an increase of 46 percent since 2007). This excludes unfunded pension and health-care commitments which would, for example, triple the U. S. government\'s debt of about $20 trillion.Businesses, too, follow this model. They emphasize short-term performance using accounting tricks to increase current income while deferring expenses and using debt-funded stock repurchases to boost earnings per share. General Electric Co.\'s current problems reflect, in part, the extend-and-pretend model: Its now-discredited expansion into finance relied on leverage and underpricing of future risk, which has necessitated payments of $15 billion over the next seven years to cover continuing liabilities.Even Berkshire Hathaway Inc. relies on extending and pretending to some extent. Its core insurance business generates premium income against promises to cover future risk. From time to time, it also sells options to generate upfront premium income. Risk is deferred until the contracts are unwound or expire. Cash flow finances the company\'s investments, much of which goes into financial institutions.In politics, extend and pretend has become standard procedure. Underinvestment in health, education and training saves money today but creates future costs and problems that may exceed any current benefit. Policies are focused on short-term growth and the maintenance of current living standards while longer-term issues are ignored.', 'TheParis Agreementmay have offered a political victory for leaders claiming to addressclimate change.But it will probably prove inadequate to limit severe changes in weather, agriculture, mortality and economic conditions.']",/article/economy-policy/extend-and-pretend-model-can-t-work-forever-former-banker-satyajit-das-118020500082_1.html

However, the resolution of large corporate stressed accounts under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code and the potential haircuts thereof are expected to increase the provisioning burden of PSBs and impact their earnings profile and capital position in the near term, the rating agency said.Moody\'s Investors Service also said that the India government\'s detailing of how much capital each public sector bank will receive in the financial year ending March 2018 is credit positive for the sector.""This announcement is a credit positive for all public sector banks, and especially the weaker ones, as the government has made it very explicit that it will ensure that all such banks meet minimum regulatory capital requirements,"" says Srikanth Vadlamani, a Moody\'s Vice President and Senior Credit Officer.']",/article/markets/nifty-psu-bank-index-recovers-3-from-intra-day-low-118020500285_1.html

The inaugural day of the trading week posted fresh high at 11,171.55; but this was followed by some consolidation with a mildly negative bias ahead of the event. On the ?Budget day? we saw some volatility but due to tail end recovery the Nifty managed to reclaim the 11,000 mark. This seemed to have become a bull-trap as the index opened lower on Friday and then continued its selling streak throughout the remaining part of the day. Eventually, the intimidating session ended with a massive cut of 2.33%; posting biggest single day fall in percentage terms after fourteen months (i.e. November 11, 2016).In our recent articles, we had drawn attention towards the important near term junction of 11,100, which was 161% ?Price Extension? of the rally seen during 2008 ? 10. This point has certainly proved its worth as the index failed to sustain above this mark and finally the much awaited correction was being witnessed.

Why should anybody do a distressed sell now, because we have grandfathered, there is no hurry to sell.""There is nothing that you are going to lose by selling it immediately. So it\'s not the effect of LTCG tax, it is the overall index of the equitymarketwhich has changed in other countries of world,"" Adhia said.Adhia, who is also the revenue secretary, said the income of the government from Securities Transaction Tax (STT) is a paltry Rs 9,000 crore.""In equitymarketthere are more number of short term capital gains transactions, so income of Rs 9,000 is mostly from short term transaction,"" he said.Currently, India imposes a 15 per cent tax on short-term capital gains made of sale of shares within a year of purchase.

Many of the big announcements so far represent multiyear plans with big headline numbers but only broadly sketched details.Cash FlowCiting the lower tax rate, AT&T Inc. said free cash flow this year will surge almost 20 percent to $21 billion, giving the phone carrier more financial flexibility.The telecom giant had already announced it would invest an additional $1 billion in the US, helping the company prepare for the transition to a new fifth-generation mobile network, and give $1,000 bonuses to workers, thanks to reforms that Chief Executive Officer Randall Stephenson called ?capital freeing.?Chief Financial Officer John Stephens also made clear the company sees reform strengthening AT&T?s financial position. ?We see a significant boost to our balance sheet, reducing $20 billion of liabilities and increasing shareholder equity by a like amount,? he said last week on a call.Lockheed Martin Corp., the world?s largest defence contractor, is earmarking some of its expected windfall for pensioners. The company plans to contribute $5 billion in cash, satisfying its required obligations until 2021.The company is also increasing its commitment to initiatives like employee training, charitable contributions for education in science and math, and the Lockheed Martin Ventures fund by $200 million, CEO Marillyn Hewson said on a call.Lockheed projects earnings will more than double this year to $15.50 a share, buoyed by the U. S. tax cuts and higher deliveries of its F-35 Lightning II fighter jet.Pharma?s PlansMerck & Co. expects its tax rate will fall to about 20 percent from 35 percent, providing added flexibility for major capital expenditures, in addition to research and development.The drugmaker expects to spend $12 billion over five years, including $8 billion in the U.

The proceeds will be invested in the company, its dividend, and remaining money will go toward deals and share repurchases.AbbVie Inc., maker of the top-selling drug Humira, plans to spend $2.5 billion on capital projects in the U.

But so far, most comparisons between human drivers and automated vehicles have been at best uneven, and at worst, unfair.', 'The statisticsmeasuring how many crashes occurare hard to argue with:More than 90 percentof car crashes in the US are thought to involve some form ofdriver error. Eliminating this error would,in two years, save as many people as the country lost inall of the Vietnam War.', 'But to me, as ahuman factors researcher, that?s not enough information to properly evaluate whether automation may actually be better than humans at not crashing. Their respective crash rates can only be determined by also knowing how many non-collisions happen. For human drivers is it one collision per billion chances to crash, or one in atrillion?', 'Assessing the rate at which things do not happen is extremely difficult. For example, estimating how many times you didn?t bump into someone in the hall today relates to how many people there were in the hallway and how long you were walking there. Also, people forget non-events very quickly, if we even notice them happening. To determine whether automated vehicles are safer than humans, researchers will need to establish a non-collision rate for both humans and these emerging driverless vehicles.', 'Comparing appropriate statistics', 'Crash statistics for human-driven carsare compiled from all sorts of driving situations, and on all types of roads. This includes people driving through pouring rain, on dirt roads and climbing steep slopes in the snow. However, much of the data on self-driving cars? safety comesfrom Western statesof the U.

The data on fully automated systems will naturally expand to cover more roads asstates allow automated vehiclesto operate more widely.', 'But it will take some time before self-drivingcars can cover as many miles in a year and in as many circumstances as human drivers presently do.', 'It is true that self-drivingcars don?t gettired, angry, frustrated or drunk. But neither can they yet react to uncertain and ambiguous situations with the same skill or anticipation of an attentive human driver, which suggests that perhaps the two stillneed to work together. Nor do purely automated vehicles possess the foresight to avoid potential peril: They largely drive from moment to moment, rather than thinking ahead to possible events literallydown the road.', 'To an automated vision system, a bus shelter full of peoplemight appear quite similar to an uninhabited corn field. Indeed, deciding what action to take in an emergency is difficult for humans, but drivers havesacrificed themselves for the greater good of others. An automated system?slimited understanding of the worldmeans itwill almost neverevaluate a situation the same way a human would. And machines can?t be specifically programmed in advance tohandle every imaginable set of events.', 'New tech brings new concerns', 'Some people may argue that the promise of simply reducing the number of injuries and deaths is enough to justify expanding the use of driverless cars.

This contrasts markedly with the approach under Prime MinisterJustin Trudeau.', 'How much longer will Canada have to pay the price so Trudeau can remind us that he is a human rights activist?', 'Take, for example, the inquiry into violence against Indigenous women and girls, and the flow of refugees and asylum seekers coming to Canada.', 'One of the most sensitive issues during Canada?s 2015 federal election was the debate about creating an inquiry into missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls.Harper resisted creating one, despite years of urging by Indigenous communities, the United Nations and human rights groups.Trudeau committed to launching a national inquiryduring the political campaign.', 'Canadians finally believed this issue would be addressed,and there was new hope for reconciliation. Trudeau promised a ?total renewal? of Canada?s relationship with Indigenous communities. Carolyn Bennett was named Minister of Indigenous and Northern Affairs, and assigned to theNational Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls.', 'But Bennett, theso-called minister of reconciliation, has proven unable to make much progress on the inquiry.', 'Itlanguishesto this day, money wasted, mired in recrimination and hostility.Expectations dashed, some from Indigenous communities say they have beenfailed once again.', 'In a recent cabinet shuffle, Trudeau split Bennett?s ministerial portfolio, a reflection of her performance in a hard job, but sheremains lead ministerfor the inquiry.Expectations remain low.', 'Polished, poised', 'Harper lost the 2015 election for several reasons ? he?d spent a long time in power, there was acharismatic new opposition leaderon the scene, and he seemed to lack patience any longer to provide the morally superior rhetoric that Canadians love. This nationalistic self-praise, proclaiming Canadians? virtue over and above all other countries, is what Canadian scholarKim Richard Nossalaptly termed ?ear candy.?', 'Not Trudeau. Polished and poised, he always says the ?right? thing. If Trudeau?s Canada is famous for anything in the world, it is for setting a good example to other countries.', 'Trudeau implemented hiselection campaign promise to allow 25,000 Syrian refugeesexpedited entry to Canada. And when U. S. President Donald Trump moved in January 2017 toban travellers from targeted Muslim-majoritycountries, Trudeau sent a tweet depicting Canada as a tolerant haven, and emphasized its welcoming, open borders.', 'Trudeau?s approach to the Syria crisis and to immigration generally is in stark contrast to theHarper government?s.His viral tweet last year was spun into a widespread media assertion that Canadawould accept everyone who came. Perhaps this was exactly what he wanted: To showcase his human rights credentials and Canada?s friendliness and compassionate attitude compared to Trump?s.', 'However, Trudeau?s tweet created a huge problem.', 'When thousands of Haitian asylum-seekers, afraidTrump might end their temporary protectedstatus that allows them to remain in the U. S., illegally crossed the border into Québec, the Trudeau government started singing a different tune. In July and August 2017,250 people a day crossedthe border, many of them Haitians. Ministers rushed to explain there was no open invitation:There are rulesthat must be adhered to, andclaiming asylum is not a free ticket into Canada.', 'Tent campsfor the initial refugee processing have been set up along the Canada-U. S. border. And more people may come. Canadianofficials are gearing up for an influxof migrants heading north in the coming months.Cancellation of protected status for the 50,000 Haitiansin the U. S. has been confirmed by the Trump administration, effective July 2019. It?s also announced that protected status for the nearly200,000 Salvadoriansliving in the U. S. won?t be renewed either.', 'There?s little doubt those migrants are eyeing Canada.', 'But Canada is not prepared to accept everyone, despite Trudeau?s tweet. It ushered in the 25,000 Syrians shortly after his election, but after that it was back to business as usual, regardless that thescale of need was in the millions.', 'Far away from the world?s war zones, Canada has always been able to roll out the welcome mat when it wanted.', 'That?s why closer to home, the asylum issue with the U. S. is causing serious concerns for the Trudeau government ? it exposes the difference between the nationalist self-congratulation that the prime minister trades in, and what Canadians are willing to accept in practice.', 'Many countries aren?t so lucky. Consider, by comparison, the refugee situation for Germany as it existed in 2015.Some days, more than 10,000 Syrian refugees arrivedin Germany. Almost20,000 arrivedin one weekend, 10,000 in Munich alone.', 'Canada has not had to cope with such numbers. What?s more, Canada is tough on those lucky enough to arrive here. Since 2000, at least16 people have diedin Canada?s system of immigration detention centres.', 'And yet Trudeau continues to burnish his personal political image and to poke Canada?s greatest ally in the eye ? most recently in Davos.', 'ATrumpsnub?', 'France?sEmmanuel Macronand China?s Xi Jinping have mounted apparently successful charm offensives to advance key priorities with Trump. Not Canada?s leader. Trudeaudid not bother to meet Trumpat the recentDavos World Economic Forumso that, he said,other leaders could have a chance.', 'Some have pointed to Trudeau?s apparent charm offensive with IvankaTrumpas clever and strategic. In addition toworking with the president?s daughteron issues facing women in the workplace,he attended the Canadian Broadwayplay,Come From Away, with her in March 2017. But the play itself was aboutCanadian inclusiveness and support for foreigners in need, not-so-subtly underscoring Trudeau?s criticism of Trump?s public policy. Is this a winning strategy?', 'For Trudeau, everything seems to be about glorifying Canada, and himself by extension. That?s not always in the best interests of Canada, but it is what Canada gets in abundance from its current prime minister. Harper,despite his private reservations about former president Barack Obama, never publicly threw shade at his fellow leader.', 'Harper was less popular than Trudeau, but Canadians could count on him for one thing ? not making his personal image on the global stage a top priority. What Trudeau says obviously appeals to Canadians. But do his actions back up his words? On Indigenous issues, on immigration, on welcoming refugees, the answer is no. Whether Canadians agreed or disagreed with Harper, his actions matched his words.', 'Trudeau almost has it all. He?s got that famous name. He?s got the central casting looks. He?s got the top job in Canada. The one thing he needs is for Canada and the world to regard him as human rights activist, because even when it disadvantages the national interest, that?s seemingly less important than his own personal interests ? a far cry from Canada?s previous prime minister.', 'Grant Dawson, Assistant Professor of Social Science and International Politics,University of Nottingham', 'This article was originally published onThe Conversation.

It?s difficult to measure advertising effectiveness, so marketers have turned to brain science for an answer.', 'For over a decade, neuroscientists have been scanning the brains of select Super Bowl viewers to see how they react to the commercials that air. Their studies purport toreveal the narratives and imagesthat best capture the public?s attention in a way that postgame surveys ofSuper Bowlaudiences cannot. This information can then be leveraged to develop more effectiveSuper Bowlads in the future.', 'Now, however, neuroscience is being used in the service of ad customization.A test conducted during last year?s Super Bowlscanned subjects? brain activity and tested their responses to different kinds of ads. Researchers adjusted the order of the ads shown during the game to fit each person?s revealed preferences. (The test required viewers to see the game on a 40-minute delay.)', 'Just as the neuroscientists had hoped, strategically altering the ordering of the ads to fit these preferences increased audience attention.', 'The ultimate goal of studies like this is to target viewers with personalized television commercials. Cable providers and television networks are bullish on using new technologies to deliver something called ?addressable television,? the process ofsending specific TV commercialsto individual households.', 'Personalized TVhas alreadybeen used to target married women with children with ads for an amusement park andinternationalfliers with ads for online travel.

It is difficult to predict how the premium will move -- whether it will go up or down.What would the expected size of the merged entity be?This will not simply be an addition of numbers, although the total premium income alone together would be around Rs 40,000 crore (Rs 400 billion). Then there will be a lot of convergence and rationalisation of offices as well.You had been in the process of having anIPO.Now with the sudden change in government decision, did you incur any costs?It is very clear now that the combined entity will go to the market. We haven?t appointed anymerchant bankersas yet, and only discussions had been going on with the government.What do you think is the rationale and government?s thinking behind themerger?In the banking sector too, government had announced that there would be consolidation, so it is continuation of government?s vision of creating a larger government-owned entity in the financial sector. This is just a natural corollary.What is the realistic timeframe for themerger?I was told that themergerwould be most likely finalised by the end of next financial year.

However, industry experts have said quoting government reports that at least 100 tonnes of gold can be mined a year in India, from a mere two tonnes currently, if mining is prioritised and permissions are issued as a part of the government\'s ease of doing business mission.""It is essential that the proposedgold policyas declared in theUnion Budgetcaters to the entire supply chain from mines to market. While much has been said about regulation on bullion and jewellery, it is essential that serious thought is given to the issue of exploring the country\'s gold mines, which will not only save foreign exchange but also generate a lot of employment in mining and refining field,? says Surendra Mehta, National Secretary, Indian Bullion and jewellers Association.The finance minister had said in his Budget speech that a comprehensivegold policywas being prepared. While the policy covers every aspect, from sourcing gold to trading and investing in it, experts assert that the policy is incomplete if mining of gold in India isn\'t promoted.Nick Spencer, Managing Director,Galaxy Gold Minessays, ?A hundred tonnes of gold is already defined as a mineable reserve in India.? He quotes from a report submitted to the the Core Group on Gold and Precious Metals constituted by the Union Ministry of Mines, which had estimated the total unrefined gold resource base in the country as on April 1, 2011 at 658 tonnes of metallic gold. The report also stated that this tonnage is spread over 13 different states. Of this tonnage 167 tonnes (139 in Karnataka and 27.5 in Andhra Pradesh alone) is categorised as reserves in the sense that it is economically mineable.', 'The remaining about 491 tonnes is classified as resource, of which 265 tonnes is the actual drilled resources and the remaining 226 tonnes is the projected potential resource.Spencer was earlier the founder-MD of Kolar Gold Plc, an Indian mining consortium listed in London. He has now moved to India and has set upGalaxy Gold Minesto help develop and build modern gold mines, using a three-tier strategy. To ensure expeditious gold production and augment dore supply in India, Galaxy has entered into a joint venture with a new gold mine inTanzania.This property will start producing one or two tonnes of gold a year by 2018-end. The JV plans to sell all thegold doreproduced in the African mines to refiners and jewellers in India, to reduce the shortfall in supply here. Secondly, Galaxy will also source and recyclegold dorefrom India and Africa for Indian refiners and jewellers.Spencer adds, ?After 12 years of exploring and developing gold projects in India, we are now working with several Indian mining groups and gold refiners to assist us with funding and government approvals needed forgold mining.We are working on six such gold projects at present.?However several bottlenecks are stoppinggold miningin India despite the proven high potential. One miner had to take as many as 120 steps and had to wait eight years before getting a mining license. Less than one per cent of exploration permits have progressed to the mining license phase due to pitfalls in the approval process.']",/article/economy-policy/mines-to-market-integration-gold-mining-lands-on-policy-makers-table-118020601248_1.html

This was partly because overall pharma growth slowed during the year, thanks to several factors, even as multinational companies saw a few months of high growth with specialised product launches.According to data sourced from AWACS, the market research wing of the All India Organisation of Chemists and Druggists (AIOCD) which represents over 500,000 medicine sellers across the country, theIndian pharmamarket (IPM) clocked 5.5 per cent growth in moving annual turnover (MAT) value ? the lowest rate in eight years.In 2016, IPM had grown 10.68 per cent ? home-grown companies, with 11.85 per cent growth, had beaten the industry rate, while multinational firms with a presence in the domestic market had clocked 6.42 per cent growth.There were several reasons for a decline in domestic pharma sales growth in the 2017 calendar year.

Because many countries perform similarly on the index, even small discrepancies in the score can produce wild swings in the rankings, which appears to have happened in India?s case?a point Martin Ravallion, former manager of the World Bank?s research department, has pointed out recently as well.', 'It seems that India?s rank moved up and down more due to the addition of new countries to the Doing Business sample than changes in methodology.', '', 'Even if you love the Doing Business index, you should acknowledge changes in ranking mean very little', 'Reasonable people disagree about the usefulness of the index. Critics point to serious conceptual flaws, like measuring the costs of regulation while ignoring the benefits, and how poorly the index predicts actual conditions as reported in business surveys. Defenders note that the index has spurred many countries to accelerate regulatory reforms which, they contend, has boosted growth.

And the controversies continue unabated. But there?s one aspect ofFacebookthat should not be lost in all the noise: the extraordinary change it has brought about in how we connect, communicate, consume and share content ? in the classroom, as well as in other spaces.', 'Putting the words ?Facebook? and ?learning? together may seem like an oxymoron. But my research has delved into the roleFacebookhas played in shaping how the new generation consumes and shares content. Understanding this is pivotal to understanding how we should be usingtechnologyto teach in the digital age. Quite simply,Facebookhas changed the way that children learn.', 'How students learn', 'That?s what I?ve discovered through my research, which used acyber-ethnographyapproach to try and determine how students are learning in our modern digital age. This involved essentially ?living? with students while they connected, communicated, and learned in aFacebookspace.', 'I spent an entire semester watching and interacting with students at the University of KwaZulu-Natal in South Africa as they used aFacebookpage as their primary learning portal. The students were given admin access to the space. This meant they could determine how the space was used: who had access to it, how it was designed, what was posted on the page, and even the level of anonymity of their posts.', 'This provided me with an opportunity to watch the students learn, unfettered from traditional learning constraints. However, it would take a while for the students to fully explore their learning within this new space. Initially the students would often attempt to defer to me and my guidance. Only after I repeatedly refused to control their learning experience did they begin to behave in aself-oraganising wayand allow me to observe their ?natural? learning patterns.', 'Theresearchrevealed thatFacebookprovided students with a series of learning affordances. Affordances are ?can do? oppportunies, some intentional andothersunintentional, thattechnologyspaces provide. In this instance the research revealed that the affordances at play were accessibility, connection, communication, control and construction.', 'These affordances provide valuable insights into how students learn in digital spaces.', 'Once I understood this, I could turn my attention to the key need: developing ways of teaching, called pedagogies, that are appropriate for the digital age. Currently the focus ontechnology? thewhat, has distracted us from pedagogy: thehow. Without understanding how best to apply these new technologies? affordances, educators will not be able to effectively impact teaching in the modern classroom.', 'However, providing educators with a list of ?how tos? isn?t much use without a system that makes the list easy to implement. As Dan Schwartz, dean of Stanford?s Graduate School of Education,says:', 'I can tell people they need to teach better. But if I don?t give them things that are easy for them to implement, they won?t do it.', 'Activating the classroom', 'That?s where theActivated Classroom Teaching (ACT) modelcomes in. I developed this model in a bid to create a taxonomy of teaching and learning for 21st century classrooms. A taxonomy is an ordered arrangement of items. One of the most famous of these isBloom?s taxonomy of thinking. The ACT model attempts to provide a taxonomy of digital-age teaching approaches.', 'The ACT model consists of five digital-age pedagogies that seek to maximise the affordances of technology, modern students? approaches to learning and the development of key 21st century skills such as creativity, problem solving, curiosity, critical thinking, etc.', 'The focus is a shift from passive ways of teaching (consumption) to active approaches (curation, conversation, correction, creation and chaos). This aligns withresearchthat shows children are spending more than half their online time actively engaging: creating content, getting involved in ?interactive consumption? and communicating.', 'Ignoring the tectonic shifts taking place in our classrooms is not the solution. Simply droppingtechnologyinto our classrooms is not the solution. Simply training teachers tousecomputers is not the solution. As British author and education expertSir Ken Robinsonhas said, we need a paradigm shift, but it?s more than that - we need a pedagogy shift.', 'The young teen, Facebook, has changed how we connect and learn.

For instance this is my second tour to South Africa, so I was better equipped for this tour, mentally and skill-wise. That plays a big role,"" said Dhawan ahead of the third ODI against South Africa tomorrow.""The good thing is there is experience and youth, but the younger players are also playing like they have had a lot of experience. That is a big strength of ours.""AndHardik Pandyagives the team the extra edge.""With an all-rounder coming in, the balance overseas is set. We have the option of not introducing spinners early, depending on the situation. So we have a lot of flexibility. If the game goes a certain way, we know that we can bring on spinners later than normal, and Hardik can bowl at that time. That is certainly an x-factor,"" he added.India, who have a poor ODI record in South Africa, is set for improvement after being 2-0 up in the six-match series.South Africa have struggled against the wrist spinners and injury to key players like Ab de Villiers, Faf du Plessis and Quinton de Kock has compounded their woes.However, Dhawan promised that India will not take their foot off the pedal.""I don\'t think we guys are going to get complacent. Its a big series for us. And of course South Africa played very well in the Test series. So we did like to go as hard as possible and try to win whatever games come our way.""Besides the injuries costing them, South Africa have been blown away by wrist spinners Yuzvendra Chahal and Kuldeep Yadav. The duo shared 13 wickets between them in the first two ODIS.""It is difficult to play wrist-spinners because they can turn the ball on flat tracks also. And when the ball starts turning, the overseas players especially aren\'t very used to it. That can create doubts in batsmen\'s minds, which is why they are effective.""If I speak of Kuldeep and Chahal, I personally find Kuldeep harder to read, and easier to read the leg spinners. There are many who cant read the leg spinners googly, so Chahal\'s googly will surely fool batsmen. But speaking for myself only, I find Kuldeep tougher to read,"" said Dhawan.The opener added that South Africa have not scored enough runs in the series, and that the opposition now has a mental fear of wrist spin. So much so, the Proteas had quite a few local leg spinners in their nets on Tuesday ahead of the third ODI.""I won\'t say its a lack of patience. You are playing one-day cricket so you have to score some runs. If you defend 50 balls and don\'t score, then that\'s of no use.', 'They are losing a lot of wickets in the middle, which is why they cant get to the targets they are trying to make,"" said the opener.""If you have some confusion or doubt in your mind, its first effect is on your thinking. No matter who the batsman, and then it shows in your batting. If they cant read our spinners, then of course they\'ll be more cautious while playing them. We do get an advantage from that.""Dhawan played the first Test here at Cape Town, but didn\'t feature at Centurion or Johannesburg. Since then, he has made a fine return to the ODI side with scores of 35 and 51 not out.He had looked good in Durban before being run-out in a mix-up with Virat Kohli.""My form was going good. Even when I wasn\'t playing, I was batting like this. The only thing is when I was not playing I worked harder, made myself fitter as I had time on my hands. I knew what I needed to work on and what challenges I could face here, what their bowlers will do against me to get me out. I\'m just enjoying my process, said Dhawan.India are set to retain the same playing eleven in the third ODI, with Rohit Sharma\'s form the only cause for concern. The three-time ODI double centurion averages only 13.44 in 10 ODIs on South African soil.""I feel Rohit is playing amazingly. The way he is timing the ball has been amazing. Even in the last match he was playing very well, but unfortunately he got out. I don\'t see any concerns with his batting.""The key for our success is we are not losing wickets on top. Of course the South African fast bowling is very strong, but we are playing them nicely. And once we cross the first 10 overs, the ball gets a bit older and we dominate more after that,"" he added.The Newlands pitch for this third ODI didn\'t appear to be as dry as the ones at Durban and Centurion. It looked a typical South African batting wicket with plenty of bounce. The outfield though looked lush green, never mind the on-going drought situation.""We all know that there is a drought here and we respect that. We are aware that we have to save as much water as we can, because people need it.

By the end of 2016-17, however, the road ministry had a larger share of the total, according to a Prabhudas Lilladher report on the road sector.Various industry officials and experts attribute this trend change to reasons ranging from ?cyclicality? issues in execution at theNHAIlevel, the government?s keenness to focus on border roads and the Northeast, and the current government?s preference of centralising operations.?The trend is cyclical in nature, and also a healthy one.

Later, it also arrested former president Maumoon Abdul Gayoom. He was president from 1978 to 2008, when theMaldivesbecame a multiparty democracy. Gayoom is Yameen?s half-brother.This isn?t a first for Yameen. Ever since coming to power, his government has eroded civil liberties and has either thrown in prison or forced into exile, all political rivals.Mohamed Nasheed, who had become president in the first multiparty elections in 2008 by defeating Gayoom, denounced the emergency decree. Nasheed currently lives in exile. He was one of the opposition politicians that the Supreme Court had ordered to be freed. Currently, Gayoom and Nasheed are part of an opposition alliance.Nasheed, who currently lives in Colombo, urged India to ?act swiftly? to help resolve the crisis. It is unlikely that Nasheed, after his recent experiences with South Block, was hoping for a repeat of \'Operation Cactus\', but has tried nevertheless.On November 3, 1988, India had launched ?Operation Cactus? to successfully foil a coup by mercenaries to restore the government of the then president Maumoon Abdul Gayoom. The US, erstwhile Soviet Russia, Great Britain and several other countries had applauded India, particularly for its ""swift"" response.But much has changed in the manner India has run its foreign policy in the last two decades by increasingly looking at international issues through a pragmatic geo-strategic prism of increasing trade, investments and security cooperation.India has significant security and economic interests in theMaldives.It has, however, gradually ceded its moral authority in recent years, Nasheed?s entreaties asking it to take a tougher position on Yameen\'s crackdown on civil liberties, in favour of securing its interests consistent with its pursuit of a more \'pragmatic\' foreign policy, even as Yameen has found increasing support from China.In the aftermath of the arrests in the Maldivian capital of Male on Monday, New Delhi issued a travel advisory asking its nationals to not travel to theMaldives.It also asked Indian expatriates living in theMaldivesto exercise caution and stay away from public gatherings. On February 2 after the Supreme Court order, New Delhi had asked Yameen?s government respect and abide by the apex court?s order. South Block had also said India was closely monitoring the situation, and hoped that law and order will be maintained.TheMaldivesis an archipelago of more than 1,190 islands in the Indian Ocean with a population of a little over 400,000.

Any restrictions on visas would directly impact ordinary citizens, which would be detrimental to Indian interests too, officials say.The other key leverage that India has in theMaldivesis as the source of most imported items. The 1981 trade agreement gives special privileges to theMaldivesfor importing items from India which are restricted to other countries. However, any restrictions on the trade of essential commodities could lead to severe shortages. This could fuel antagonism towards India among the Maldivian public ? and again, could be unhelpful.There are ?harder? options too, say sources familiar with the relationship, but it would depend on how the situation evolves in the country.New Delhi is also aware that President Yameen, having taken the extreme step of declaring emergency, may only be amenable to stronger measures.The only time India has directly intervened in theMaldiveswas in 1988, when a small military deployment flew to the atoll nation to defend the Gayoom government against a takeover by mercenaries.Yameen?s moves had been steadily raising concern as presidential elections are scheduled this year. The near decimation of the opposition ? most leaders are in custody or outside on exile ? would ensure that there were not any viable candidates standing against him in the polls.A possible hint about India?s next move is in the travel advisory issued by the Ministry of External Affairs immediately afterMaldivesgovernment announced the declaration of emergency.?The prevailing political developments inMaldivesand the resultant law and order situation is a matter of concern for the Government of India,? said the advisory, which however did not explicitly refer to the Emergency. It also asked Indian nationals to ?defer all non-essential travels to Male and other atolls until further notice.? (emphasis added)The mention of the ?law and order? situation could be a probable trigger for India to intervene more visibly in the Indian ocean island nation.?Indian expatriates inMaldivesare also alerted to the need for heightened security awareness and urged to exercise due caution in public and avoid public gatherings,? said the Indian advisory. As per MEA estimates, there are 25,000 Indian nationals living in the Maldives, along with 108 Persons of Indians Origin (PIOs).Indian tourist arrivals in theMaldiveshave increased by 24% in 2017 compared to the previous year. Chinese tourists declined by 5.5%, but they still constitute 22% of foreign tourists while India has only a 6% share. The region which is the biggest source for foreign tourists is Europe, which account for 46.5% of arrivals in theMaldives.So travel advisories from India, China, the US, UK and EU will certainly impact the tourism industry.India urged to act tougherUnlike other countries, India has usually been rather reticent in commenting on Maldivian political developments, which had sometimes led the opposition parties there to complain that New Delhi was losing focus in the region.Indian officials argued that India could not afford to be more forthcoming in its public statements, as unlike the US and UK, there was a direct impact of developments in theMaldiveson India?s security situation.Therefore, India joining the chorus of western countries in asking President Yameen to implement the Supreme Court?s February 1 order was significant. India?s official response said that it was ?imperative? that theYameen governmentshould implement the apex court?s judgment. The statement had also made special mention about the need to ensure the safety and security of Indian expatriates.Reiterating the safety of Indian expatriates, along with the reference to the law and order situation, in Monday?s travel advisory is notable insofar as the ?law and order situation? in the Indian Ocean nation is said to be calm.Till now, the only reported clashes between police and opposition supporters took place in the early hours of February 2. When the emergency was declared, the Maldivian capital Male was lashed with rains and remained quiet, but tense. While opposition supporters did try to come out on the streets, the heavy deployment of policy and military and blockading of roads prevented any confrontation.Former president Mohamed Nasheed, who is among the political prisoners listed by the Supreme Court for immediate release, urged India to ?act swiftly?. He declared the emergency declaration as tantamount to imposing martial law.?This deliberate refusal by the government to uphold the constitution further destabilises theMaldivesand wider Indian Ocean security. President Nasheed continues to engage with concerned international partners, including India and other neighbouring countries, seeking resolutions to the ongoing crisis and urges India to act swiftly,? said a statement issued by his office.In a tweet, the United StatesNationalSecurity Council warned theYameen governmentand military to respect democratic institutions, since the ?the world is watching?. The US has also advised its nationals that the Maldivian capital may witness demonstrations from February 6 to 15 due to the emergency declaration.America stands with the people ofMaldives.The Maldivian government and military must respect the rule of law, freedom of expression, and democratic institutions. The world is watching.? NSC (@WHNSC)February 5, 2018In a scathing indictment, US state department spokesperson Heather Neuert said that President Yameen had ?systematically alienated? all his coalition partners, diluted human rights law, curbed freedom of expression and weakened democratic institutions since his election in 2013.Yameen had managed a win the run-off for the 2013 presidential elections by 51.39% against Nasheed. However, Yameen?s narrow win was largely on the shoulders of Gayoom?s campaigning and support provided by Jumhooree Party?s Gasim Ibrahim.TheMaldivespresident has cause for worry about his poll prospects if he goes it alone. In the last significant elections, the MDP won 46% of the seats at the local bodies polls in May 2017.Stating that the US was ?troubled and disappointed? with the declaration of Emergency, Neuert called upon President Yameen and security forces to fully comply with the Supreme Court?s ruling, ensure proper functioning of parliament and restore constitutionally-guaranteed rights.British foreign secretary Boris Johnson also called upon Yameen to ?peacefully end the state of emergency, restore all articles of the constitution, take immediate steps to implement in full the order of the Supreme Court, and to permit and support the full, free and proper functioning of Parliament?.China had already advised its citizens to avoid theMaldivesin a statement on Monday morning. This was an upgrade from its previous advisory of February 2, which had only asked Chinese citizens to be cautious in travelling to the country.Making no explicit mention of the Supreme Court order that has precipitated the current crisis, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Geng Shuang said that ?all relevant parties? have to resolve differences through dialogue. ?What happens for the time being in theMaldivesfalls within the internal affairs of that country.China supports all relevant parties in theMaldivesin properly resolving differences through dialogue and negotiation and in safeguardingnationaland social stability,? he said.For the Yameen administration, China is now its principal backer, since Saudi Arabia has largely backed off from its ambitious plans in the island nation.The Wire had reported Monday morning that the Supreme Court justices, who were being pressured by the Yameen government, had taken refuge in the premises of the top court on Sunday evening. Sources in the Maldivian judiciary had anticipated that the government would be making attempts to arrest the two key judges ? Chief Justice Abdulla Saeed and Justice Ali Hameed ? and replace them with more amenable jurists.Both the US and UK ambassadors spoke to the chief justice on Monday to express solidarity and also learnt ?about the great pressure judges are under?. Maldivian opposition leader Nasheed had also spoken to the chief justice who remained besieged in his office. The Indian high commissioner remained in touch with all relevant authorities, Indian officials said, though they provided no details on the record.TheMaldivesresident on Monday morning sent three separate letters which called upon the Supreme Court to revoke its order of February 1 and also cancel the annulment of warrant against the chief judicial administrator Hassan Saeed, deemed loyal to the chief justice. The Supreme Court rejected all three letters.The presidency then sent another letter through the internal document messaging system.With the Supreme Court also in no mood to relent from its constitutional position, the declaration of emergency did not come as a surprise to observers.According to the presidential decree, the emergency was declared to ?protect peace and welfare? of citizens following the Supreme Court order of February 1. The official press release said that the step had been taken as the implementation of the Supreme Court judgment would have resulted in ?the disruption of the functions of the executive power and the state institutions vested with specific mandates under the constitution, the infringement ofnationalsecurity and public interest, and if implemented, which would potentially lead to an undermining of the supremacy of the constitution of the Republic of Maldives?.Yameen had previously announced emergency in 2015 for 30 days after he claimed there was an assassination threat against him. He had to lift the emergency within a week, due to criticism from foreign countries.The key difference with this declaration of emergency has been the wide swathe of constitutional articles which have been put into abeyance. This includes articles on the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court and the right of parliament to remove a sitting president.Husnu Al Suood, president of theMaldivesBar Association told The Wire that the declaration of emergency was constitutional but not the suspension of the Supreme Court. ?[Yameen?s] declaration has suspended the Supreme Court. But, according to article 258 [of theMaldivesconstitution], the Supreme Court has to determine the validity of any challenge to a declaration of emergency. It means that there is no power given under the constitution to suspend the Supreme Court under emergency provisions,? he said.Suood had been in direct touch with the Chief Justice Abdulla Saeed, who had issued an appeal through him to the public even as the police stands ready to storm the SC premises. He also told The Wire that the judges had been staying inside the building without any food as the police had stopped all entry and exit for over a day.MaldivesCJ called me a a little while ago and asked me to inform the public to to protect him and the institution.

Before he was formally arrested, his aide recorded a video which was posted on Twitter.?Right now, the police are here to arrest me. I remain steadfast in my resolve.

However, our latest research,published in PNAS, suggests that there is another, equally important mechanism by which cancer arises: anageing immune system.We were interested in why the incidence of cancer rises so steeply with age. The conventional wisdom is that it?s due to a single cell in the body accumulating just the right sequence of genetic mutations that transform it into a cancer cell, seeding a tumour.', 'It takes a long time for six or seven key mutations to randomly occur in the same cell, so the chance of cancer arising in this way would be very small when a person is young, but would rise dramatically into middle and old age. This model has been the foundation of cancer research for decades and fits well with the molecular evidence that cancer cells have scrambled genomes.Shrinking Thymus gland', 'But, what about the fact that the body is itself ageing? Do our increasingly frail bodies become intrinsically more susceptible to cancer over the years? We looked at a key aspect of ageing: the declining immune system. In particular, we looked at the dramatic shrinkage of the thymus gland, which halves in size every 16 years from birth.', 'The thymus produces newT cells? whiteblood cellsthat scan the body for invaders. If the immune system is helping keep cancer at bay, it stands to reason that cancer will become more likely as a person ages.', 'To test our idea we created a mathematical model. The model is not meant to describe in detail what is going on ? after all, the immune system itself is an extraordinarily complex biological system. Our aim was to capture the essence of the problem in the model, make predictions, and then test them rigorously against data.', 'We assumed that cancer cells are arising in the body at a constant rate throughout life, but that the immune system is highly effective at identifying and destroying them. However, no system is perfect. One can imagine that a cancer cell, trying to grow a new tumour, may through sheer luck evade the immune system.', 'Such rare events would become less rare as we age due to the natural decline of the immune system.', 'From this logic, we derived a mathematical prediction for cancer incidence.', 'We used data on cancer incidence ? collected from over 2m patients and covering over 100 different types of cancer ? from the US National Cancer Institute to test our predictions. We compared how well our model fitted the data to the traditional mutation model.', 'Our model fitted better, overall, than the mutation model. This was initially quite shocking, given the enormous status of the mutation model and the simplified approach we took in constructing our immune-decline model.', 'A striking observation from the data was that for some cancers, and also some infectious diseases, rising incidence with age exactly mirrors the exponential decline of the immune system ? a natural prediction from our model, but very hard to explain from the mutation model.Why men are more susceptible to cancer', 'To test our model more stringently, we decided to look at a curious feature of cancer incidence that is not well understood: for most cancers there is a significantly higher incidence in men than in women. This is not easily explained from a purely genetic viewpoint, as men and women share the same basic genome, apart from the different sex chromosomes. So researchers have wondered whether environmental or hormonal factors are responsible.', 'It turns out that our model is able to give a direct explanation; immune system decline occurs more slowly in women than in men. We were able to fit male and female cancer incidence data separately with our model, just using the fact that the immune decline occurs at different rates between the two.', 'For those cancers that our model fitted particularly well, the pivot age is between 50 and 60 years. This has direct clinical relevance and may become a useful diagnostic indicator to give doctors an idea on when to improve screening for various cancers.', 'What next? We are the first to stress that it is early days, and that our model needs to be rigorously examined and tested by cancer biologists and medical doctors. It is unlikely to survive unchanged, but we hope that it contains the seed of a new approach to cancer.', 'Another cause of cautious optimism is the following observation. Nearly all vertebrates have a shrinking thymus gland, the exception being some species of shark; and sharks are known to have extremely low rates of cancer.', 'Sam Palmer, Research Assistant Professor,Heriot-Watt UniversityandThea Newman, Emeritus Professor,University of Dundee', 'This article was originally published onThe Conversation.

Before the eight per cent decline in United States stocks over the past week, the S&P 500 had gone two years without suffering a drop that large. Spoiled by this unnaturally placid stretch, many Americans had forgotten what a routine market setback even looks like.They better get used to this. Going back three decades, the average market drop in any given year has typically been around 10 per cent. What Americans are witnessing now is thus a return to normal market behavior, which has never followed a straight line.This year could be pivotal, because the conditions that underpinned the steady upward march of stock prices are now likely to deteriorate. In the United States and around the world, stocks have been buoyed by the trifecta of accelerating global growth, low inflation and loose central bank policies, all of which are now poised to turn against the bubbly market.Optimists believe that theglobal economycan still grow at four per cent, the pace it maintained during the post-World War II miracle. But the miracle was driven mainly by the postwar baby boom, which ended years ago. Many investors have yet to internalize the fact that four per cent growth is unrealistic. Fewer workers means slower economic growth, and will make it difficult for the world economy to sustain even its 2017 pace of just over 3 per cent growth.Fewer workers also mean labor shortages and higher inflation. Unemployment rates are close to a 40-year low in developed economies, including the United States. If theUnited States economykeeps adding 200,000 jobs per month, as it did in January, the unemployment rate could fall below 3.5 per cent by the end of the year. And a rate that low has never been sustained in the past.If you account for people who are between jobs or who can no longer work as a result of disability, the data suggest that nearly every American who wants a job has one. The same can be said for developed countries from Germany to Japan.This looming shortage of workers is now putting upward pressure on wage growth, which has been steadily rising in recent months. And historically, wage growth has been a strong driver of inflation, as workers use their expanded paycheck to bid up prices for goods and services.This then is the big picture: Over the past year, investors worldwide have been pleasantly surprised by an unusual combination of economic growth beating their expectations and inflation undershooting expectations.', 'These pleasant surprises fed an unnatural calm. Over the coming year, these forces are likely to reverse, as labor shortages slow growth and begin to drive up inflation, and bring a normal level of volatility back to themarkets.']",/article/international/the-stock-market-is-volatile-again-get-used-to-it-118020601330_1.html

It was not immediately clear what charges they faced, if any. The whereabouts of the court\'s other two judges were not clear Tuesday morning.Later, former dictator and opposition politicianMaumoon Abdul Gayoomwas seen on cellphone video shot by his daughter being quietly escorted from his home by security forces, hugging friends and family and waving to supporters before being driven away.Shortly before his arrest he sent a message on Twitter saying a large deployment of police had surrounded his house: ""To protect me or to arrest me? No idea.""His lawyer, Maumoon Hameed, said Gayoom faced charges including bribery and attempting to overthrow the government. Gayoom was president from 1978 to 2008, when theMaldivesbecame a multiparty democracy.The president\'s main rival, exiled former President Mohamed Nasheed, denounced the emergency decree and urged people not to obey what he called an ""unlawful order.""""This declaration is unconstitutional and illegal,"" Nasheed, the country\'s first democratically elected leader, said in a statement.Nasheed, who lives in exile, was among the opposition politicians ordered freed by the Supreme Court.TheMaldivesis an archipelago of more than 1,000 islands with fewer than 400,000 citizens, more than one-third of them living in the crowded capital city,Male.Tourism now dominates the country\'s economy, with wealthy foreigners flown to hyper-expensive resort islands.But it remains, in many ways, a small community.', 'Gayoom, the former dictator, is the half brother of President Yameen. The two men are now political enemies. Nasheed, the opposition leader, unseated Gayoom in the country\'s first democratic elections in 2008. But he and Gayoom are now political allies in an opposition alliance.The surprise, unanimous Supreme Court ruling last week ordering the release of the imprisoned opposition leaders has led to increasing turmoil, with Yameen lashing out at the court, opposition protests spilling into the streets of Male, and soldiers in riot gear stopping lawmakers from meeting in the parliament building.Yameen, in a statement issued after the state of emergency was announced on state television, said that while ""certain rights will be restricted, general movements, services and businesses will not be affected.""The emergency decree followed a series of letters exchanged by the government and the Supreme Court, arguing whether last week\'s order was legal and whether the prisoners could be freed.Nasheed was one of the opposition leaders the Supreme Court had ordered freed, ruling that the guilty verdicts had been politically influenced.The United Nations, United States and other foreign governments have urged theMaldivesto respect the court order.']",/article/international/maldives-political-crisis-former-leader-2-supreme-court-judges-arrested-118020600421_1.html

Although I haven?t been in touch withpoliticsin the region for some time, this slogan could well turn out to be true. There have been increased instances of violence againstChristiansin India over the last few years? Sangliana toldBusiness Standardwithout elaborating how this would affect the BJP?s prospects in the upcoming polls in the three north-eastern states of Meghalaya,NagalandandTripura.Each of these states assemblies has 60 seats.Sangliana?s claims of rising violence againstChristiansin India is substantiated in a report byPersecution Relief.The report documents that there were 379 cases of violence against the Christian community in 12 states of India in 2017 -? up 40 per cent over 2016. Almost a third of the violent incidents were reported in the two BJP-ruled states of Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh, according to the NGO?s report. Non-BJP-ruled states like Tamil Nadu and Kerala also showed an increase in violence against the community.With Sangliana indirectly indicating that these issues would influence Christian voters, theCongressmay well be inclined to paintBJPas a tormentor ofChristiansin the upcoming polls. And if theCongresssucceeds in its electoral pitch, it could spell bad news for theBJPin at least two of the three states going to polls later this month. That?s because bothMeghalayaandNagalandare Christian-majority states. According toCensusof India figures, 75 per cent of Meghalaya?s population is Christian while 88 per cent of Nagaland?s population belongs to this community. With theCongressplanning to play the Christian card, things could get tough for theBJPinMeghalaya.The party has been consistently losing its influence in the state since 2003. While it has never won a seat in Meghalaya, its vote share has declined from 5.4 per cent in 2003 to 1.3 per cent in the last assembly elections held in 2013.But theBJPhas three reasons to be optimistic about its prospects despite being up against a formidable adversary and an electorate that doesn?t fit into either its caste or religious calculations. Firstly, almost 13 per cent of Meghalaya?s population will become eligible to vote for the first time in the 2018 assembly elections scheduled to be held on February 27. These people, who were 10 to 14 years old when they were counted in the last Census, are expected to be more in tune with mainstreampoliticsthan their parents. With Modi?s image entrenched as a messiah peddling dreams to the young, these voters could potentially gravitate towards theBJP.Secondly, fighting the elections with Conrad Sangma'sNational People?s Party(NPP) would be a shot in the arm for the BJP?s prospects in the state. Conrad is the son of lateCongressrenegade and Lok Sabha speakerP A Sangma.This was evident in the 2014 parliamentary polls, when Sangma?s party, along with BJP, got almost 32 per cent of the vote share, winning one out of the two seats in the state. TheBJPalone got more than nine per cent of the vote share -? a significant jump as compared to its previous assembly election results. P A Sangma, even after his death in 2016, remains popular among the state?s majority Christian population."", ""With Conrad leading the charge, an invocation of Sangma's name could decisively swing the mandate in favour of the BJP-NPPalliance.Thirdly, eight members of legislative assembly (MLAs), including five from the Congress, switched to Conrad Sangma?s camp in December last year. With these rebel MLAs now part of the BJP-ledNorth EastDemocratic Alliance (NEDA), theCongressand other state parties such asUnited Democratic Party(UDP) could have a hard time staving off the challenge posed by these defectors working alongside Conrad Sangma?s foot soldiers. With such strong tailwinds, theBJPcould well be propelled towards its best performance inMeghalayatill date.A similar situation awaits theBJPinNagaland.The BJP?s fortunes in the state have consistently declined over the years. In 2003, the party had won seven seats with an 11 per cent vote share. In the last assembly elections in 2013, the party was reduced to a single seat, with its vote share plummeting below two per cent. No wonder the BJP?s apparatchiks have decided to call off their 15-year-long alliance with theNaga People?s Front(NPF). With Modi being seen as leader who orchestrated the Naga peace accord, theBJPcould reap some electoral benefits from these perceptions among Naga voters. TheNagalandpolls too are hanging in balance. With less than 24 hours to go for nominations to close, none of the candidates have yet filed their papers. This has raised the prospect of a blanket boycott of elections inNagaland.Perhaps, theBJPis most excited about its prospects inTripuradespite facing its most daunting challenge in the state, where theCommunist Party of India (Marxist)has been in power for 25 years. The BJP?s campaign inTripurais being managed by Sunil Deodhar, who was Narendra Modi?s campaign manager in Varanasi in the 2014 parliamentary elections. Like Meghalaya, the party has poached several opposition leaders, including a former president of theCongress.This forced CPM politburo member Prakash Karat, at a recent election meeting in the state, to reportedly admit, ?All earlier elections in the state were fought between the Left Front and theCongress.But this time, it is a contest between theBJPand the Left Front asCongressleaders and supporters had joined the saffron party.?Tripurais also the kind of electoral playground where the BJP, now in power at the Centre, would want to test itsHindutvamaxim afresh. According toCensusfigures, the Hindu population in the state has grown by 12 per cent between 2001 to 2011. But the Muslim population inTripurahas grown by 56 per cent during the same period. The Christian population meanwhile has grown almost a quarter. This has led to a drop in the proportion ofHindusin Tripura?s population, even though they continue to be the largest majority in the state. WithCongressusing the Christian card against theBJPand the saffron party raring to unleash itsHindutvafirepower, the elections to these three North-Eastern states could well be the most high-voltage contest witnessed in a long time.""]",/article/politics/why-bjp-doesn-t-need-to-become-bharatiya-jesus-party-in-north-east-india-118020600880_1.html

Treasury bonds are issued by the US government to finance its fiscal deficit, which is the difference between what a government earns and spends.This jump in yields was completely unexpected and it caught everyone by surprise. The economists, as usual, got their forecasts majorly wrong. The 10-year yield has been on an upward move for a while now, but it wasn?t expected to reach the level of 2.85%, anytime soon.Take the case of Survey of Professional Forecasters carried out by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia (The American Federal Reserve system, unlike other central banking systems, is made up of 12 Federal Reserve Banks). In this survey, the forecasters expected the 10-year yield to touch 2.7%, during the second quarter of 2018, and 2.8%, during the third quarter of 2018. The Survey said that the 3% yield would be hit only by the fourth quarter of 2018. Nevertheless, economists and correct forecasts, usually don?t go together and that has been proven all over again. The question is why are the yields rising so quickly, and what does this have to do with the stockmarketsfalling all over the world, over the last few days.The American government has cut the corporate tax rate. While this will mean a greater profit for American companies, it will also mean that the American government will collect lesser taxes and will have to borrow more in order to cover its fiscal deficit. Fiscal deficit is the difference between what a government earns and what it spends.Because the government will borrow more, it will have to pay a higher rate of interest than it currently is."", 'The market also expects the Federal Reserve to now hike interest rates four times this year, instead of three times that it expected earlier.']",/article/economy-policy/market-sell-off-brings-10-year-american-treasury-yield-back-in-focus-118020700263_1.html

How will you ensure that road sector is sufficiently funded?The revenue collected in the fund will be distributed to the respective sectors. In the previousNational Democratic Alliancegovernment under Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, when I was a minister in the Maharashtra government, I had approached the Centre for building some roads in the state. At that time the question of funding those projects was raised and then it was decided the Centre would levy a cess on petrol and diesel and the revenue collected would be given to theRoad Ministryand theNational Highways Authority of India(NHAI) for their projects. Later, the Railways and states were added to the list of beneficiaries from the levy and each sector was earmarked a share from the cess kitty. We also wanted to include inland waterways in that list and proposed amendments to theNational Waterways Act.The proposal has been approved by the Lok Sabha and is pending in the Rajya Sabha.Now, a committee under the finance minister will decide the allocation from the CRIF. We hope we will continue to get funds for the projects on which work has already begun.The FM had also announced an SPV (special purpose vehicle) for NHAI's road assets. How will this be structured?We have 105 highway contracts that can be monetised to raise Rs 1,250 billion. The funds collected via monetisation will be kept in an SPV, to be utilised forNHAIprojects.How effectively have you been able to increase the pace of road construction? What is your target for next year?We will achieve 28 km per day by March-end. We want to get to 40 km per day target next year and should be able to achieve it. We want to have 200,000 km of national highways.Is land acquisition still a challenge?There are some people who convert challenges into opportunities.

Circle rates are state governments? benchmark or reference property prices on which they calculate thestamp dutypayable. They are also known as ?ready reckoner? or ?collector rates?.For example, according to the present practice, if a property being sold is valued at Rs 10 million, but thecircle rateis Rs 10.05 million, the buyer has to pay tax on Rs 500,000 based on his slab rate. An individual in the 30 per cent tax bracket pays Rs 150,000 in tax. The difference is considered as a ?profit? for the buyer under section 56(2) of theIncome-taxAct. However, according to the Budget proposal, he will not need to pay any tax in case the variation is up to 5 per cent.A seller needs to calculate his capital gains on the basis of the price considered forstamp dutyunder section 50C.', 'Now, the seller?s tax liability will be slightly lower. If the gains at present were, say, Rs 798,120. It would come down by Rs 100,000 (see table).']",/article/pf/budget-2018-how-jaitley-s-circle-rate-move-will-impact-real-estate-deals-118020700499_1.html

In their speeches to the motion of thanks, Congress's Ghulam Nabi Azad in theRajya Sabhaand Mallikarjun Kharge in the Lok Sabha have reminded the government of its promise to create 20 million jobs a year.While the numbers in theRajya Sabhawould change when the next biennial election to a third of the 245-seats take place in April, the BJP-ledNationalDemocratic Alliance is currently way short of the majority mark. The biennial polls would help BJP, along with its allies, inch closer to the majority mark thanks to its successive wins in state assembly polls, particularly in Uttar Pradesh.The opposition, however, is emboldened that BJP-led NDA?s numbers could dwindle in case of a vote in theRajya Sabhasince several of BJP?s allies are currently upset. There is a possibility, an opposition source said, that the Telugu Desam Party (TDP), theShiv Senaand the Shiromani Akali Dal, might abstain from voting. In the past one week, all three have criticised the Modi government. On Tuesday, the TDP protested in both Houses to demand a special package for Andhra Pradesh. In the Lok Sabha on Tuesday, in his speech on the motion of thanks, Shiv Sena?s Anandrao Adsul said it seemed the government didn?t belong to theNDAanymore, but only to theBJP.In 2015, and again in 2016, the opposition had combined together to successfully move amendments to the motion of thanks to the President?s address. The wins in theRajya Sabhawere largely symbolic. The government has a majority in the Lok Sabha and threw out theRajya Sabhaamendments in that House.In 2016, the Leader of the Opposition and seniorCongressleader Ghulam Nabi Azad had moved an amendment expressing regret that the President?s address did not commit support to rights of all citizens to contest panchayat elections. It was carried.In 2015, Communist Party of India (Marxist)?s Sitaram Yechury had moved an amendment to insert a line on the Modi government?s failure to curb high-level corruption and bring back black money."", 'It was also carried.In 2017, the opposition had planned to move an amendment that demonetisation caused widespread pain and led to deaths of over a hundred people. However, the amendment was defeated as the opposition didn?t have numbers. TheCongresshad walked out in protest of Prime Minister Modi?s remarks on former prime minister Manmohan Singh. In his reply to the motion of thanks, the PM had said only Singh knows ?the art of bathing in a bathroom with a raincoat on? as his image has remained clean even when there were many scams around him.However, on Tuesday evening, theCongressleadership seemed intent to push for a vote. The PM is set to reply to the motion of thanks in theRajya Sabhaon Wednesday.Amendments moved by the opposition range from farmer distress to lack of jobs. However, it is joblessness that the opposition is likely to push for a vote, particularly after the controversy over PM?s remarks about selling ?pakodas?, which party chief Amit Shah defended in his maiden speech in theRajya Sabhaduring the debate on the motion of thanks on Monday.CPI (M)?s TK Rangarajan, CP Narayanan, KK Ragesh and K Somaprasad want to insert that the President?s address did not mention growing unemployment and jobless growth in the country, and the government?s failure in providing employment.CongressMP T Subbarami Reddy has also moved an amendment that the House regrets the President?s address did not mention about formulation of a comprehensive scheme for tackling growing unemployment and to create more employment opportunities in the rural areas.Last week, 17opposition partieshad agreed to coordinate their parliamentary strategy. However, Trinamool Congress?s Derek O?Brien said his party believes the office of the President is a constitutional post and should not be embarrassed. ACongressleader said the party was planning to reach out to all others on Wednesday.Usually, opposition members withdraw their amendments on the express request of the government of the day and also as a mark of parliamentary cooperation. There have been five occasions, all in the Rajya Sabha, and two of these in the tenure of the Modi government, when the Opposition has voted to successfully amend the government?s motion of thanks.

He said theCongressparty had a golden opportunity in the years after the independence to take the country forward. However, it busied itself in serving one family, the Nehru-Gandhi dynasty, instead of the country.In his speech, the PM seemed conscious that themiddle classis disappointed with this year'sUnion Budget.He also responded to the criticism his government has faced on the question of its ?failure? to fulfill to commitment to generate 20 million jobs a year and double farmer incomes.Modi repeatedly brought up the issue ofcorruption.He said theCongresswas now opposed his government?s policies, particularly implementation ofAadhaarand goods and service tax, because these steps have hurt the interests of middlemen.?When the corrupt and middlemen are out of work, obviously theCongresswill be unhappy,? the PM said.Without namingCongresspresident Rahul Gandhi, who was sitting in the House, the PM alleged theCongressleader had indulged in defaming the country during his visits abroad. ?You were talking to the Chinese when the country was fighting the battle of Doklam?You questioned the bravery of our soldiers by questioning the surgical strike,? Modi said.The PM accused theCongressof having been smallminded in governing the country during its long years in power. He didn?t spare first prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru, and blamed Mahatma Gandhi, but without naming the father of the nation, for preferring Nehru to Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, as the first prime minister of independent India.However, all through his speech, the PM was harangued byTelugu Desam Party(TDP) members. TheTDPmembers had trooped into the well of the House to shout slogans to demand that the government fulfill its promises made toAndhra Pradesh.The PM said theAtal Bihari Vajpayeegovernment carved out Uttarakhand, Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh seamlessly, but the UPA-ledCongressgovernment made a mess of the division ofTelanganafromAndhra Pradeshbecause its objective was notnationalinterest but winning elections.Digging into history, the PM sought to attribute the problems inAndhra Pradeshon to Rajiv Gandhi, who as a newly appointedCongressgeneral secretary had landed at the Begumpet airport where he had insulted the thenCongresschief minister of the state T Anjaiah. Modi stressed that Anjaiah was a Dalit, and the insult to the chief minister led to the birth of NT Rama Rao?s TDP, which threw out theCongressin the subsequent election on the plank of Telugu self-respect.On the mounting non-performing assets of public sector banks, the PM said this was a legacy issue his government has inherited from the Congress-led UPA. He said the UPA government made banks give loans to its ?favourites?.?You will have to give an account (of your evil deeds) to the country,? Modi said. He criticised the Congress?s ?hit and run politics?. ?The lotus (BJP?s election symbol) will bloom brighter the more mud you throw on us,? the PM said.BJPmembers gave him a standing ovation as he concluded his 90-minute long speech.Earlier in his speech, the PM dwelled on the issue ofcorruptionfor significant time."", 'At a time when theCongresshas asked him questions on theRafalefighter jet deal, the PM said his government, within months of coming to power, had renegotiated a gas supply deal with Qatar and save the country Rs 80 billion (Rs 8,000 crore).']",/article/politics/pm-modi-uses-2014-election-style-speech-in-parliament-to-tear-into-congress-118020700923_1.html

Most importantly, it will have zero tailpipe emissions. We certainly see this technology solution as the biggest enabler for our STUs and the biggest contributor to our nation?s mobility vision of becoming 100 per cent electric,? he added.The company claims that by separating the battery from the bus for the first time, the upfront cost of the bus is drastically reduced to be at par with a traditional diesel bus. The bus is designed for Indian mass transport usage as the compact and light form factor of the battery allows for more passenger space and standing room."", 'The swappable technology is compatible across a variety of bus platforms and works on the pay-per- use model of battery consumption.

The author looks at the rationale behind the RBI's decision to maintain a neutral stance in its monetary policy review.There are three main takeaways from the credit policy that was presented today. First is that theRBIis broadly in consonance with the Economic Survey with regards to growth. While GVA growth for FY18 has been put at 6.6%, it would broadly amount to around 6.7-6.8% growth in GDP for this year. Also heartening is the fact that its projection for FY19 at 7.2% would also mean GDP growth in the region of just less than 7.5%. At any rate, this would be an improvement for the economy. More importantly, theRBIhas pointed out that the recap of banks will help in fostering investment as banks would be better equipped to lend now.The second highlight is the view on inflation. There is an acceptance that higher inflation is here to stay with us which means that the number of 5.1% projected for Q4 would actually move upwards in H1-FY19 to the region of 5.1-5.6% before retreating to 4.5-4.6% in H2-0FY19 provided monsoon is good as the base effects come into play. The policy has rightly pointed to the importance of the Budget in this number. It has brought to the fore thefiscal deficitand borrowing programme which can lead to higher demand pull forces. The fact that there was slippage last year means that ti cannot be ruled out this time too."", 'More importantly, the increase in customs rates on several goods as well as the proposed hike in MSP would lead to cost-push inflation. This is where the government comes in. The Budget has been agnostic to price support in the downward direction of fuel products which can be gauged by the unchanged fuel subsidy as well as higher duty collections on fuel products. Now, if the oil price remains elevated a tough call has to be taken whether or not to provide the extra subsidy or cut duty rates to quell inflation. The ball would be in the government?s court.']",/article/economy-policy/three-key-takeaways-from-the-rbi-s-policy-review-118020701058_1.html

""She is being groomed as one of the North\'s most powerful figures by her brother.""Kim Yo-Jong, believed to be aged about 30, was promoted in October to be an alternate member of the party\'s powerful politburo, the decision-making body presided over by her brother.She has frequently been seen accompanying her brother on his ""field guidance trips"" and other events and is known to have been involved in the party\'s propaganda operations.The North has always kept its leadership within the family --Kim Jong-Unis the third generation of the dynasty to lead the country, after his father Kim Jong-Il and grandfather Kim Il-Sung, the North\'s founder.Kim Jong-Il fathered bothKim Jong-Unand Kim Yo-Jong with his third partner, former dancer Ko Yong-Hui.But other family members have not fared so well -- Kim Jong-Un\'s uncle was executed for treason two years after the younger man came to power, and his half-brother was assassinated in a Malaysian airport last year.The delegation\'s three-day trip will be the diplomatic high point of the rapprochement between the two Koreas triggered by thePyeongchangOlympics in the South, which have their opening ceremony on Friday -- although analysts warn that their newly warmed relations may not last long beyond the Games.For months Pyongyang ignored Seoul\'s entreaties to take part in a ""peace Olympics"", untilKim Jong-Unindicated his willingness to do so in his New Year speech.That set off a rapid series of meetings which saw the two agree to march together at the opening ceremony and form a unified women\'s ice hockey team, their first for 27 years.Officially the delegation will be headed by Kim Yong-Nam, who leads the presidium of the Supreme People\'s Assembly, the North\'s rubber-stamp parliament.He is regarded as the ceremonial head of state, and will technically be the most senior official from the North ever to travel to the South.But he is largely considered a figurehead whose public diplomatic role leaves it unclear how much political power he really has.He previously led the North\'s delegations to the 2008 Beijing Olympics and 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics, but does not hold the title of national president -- and nor doesKim Jong-Un.Instead it is retained by Kim Il-Sung, who remains Eternal President of the Democratic People\'s Republic of Korea -- the country\'s official name -- despite dying in 1994.Also in the delegation will be Ri Son-Gwon, who as head of the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Country is the equivalent of the South\'s unification minister, responsible for inter-Korean affairs.']",/article/international/winter-olympics-in-a-first-kim-jong-un-s-family-member-to-visit-s-korea-118020700720_1.html

When Nehru died in 1964, theNew York Timesplainly referred to him as the ?maker of modern India?;the Economistran a cover story titled ?World without Nehru?. It recalled his ?almost magical grip? on the masses and regretted that the world stage would be poorer without the ?great man?.There has been a considerable shift in opinion about Nehru in India. He was idolised by the public while he lived but nowadays there is a tendency to try and actively forget him or diminish his role. Now Prime Minister Modi has told parliament that ?India did not get democracy due to Pandit Nehru, asCongresswants us to believe.? Nehru has been dropped from school textbooks of Class VIII in the state of Rajasthan. He did not find a mention in aNationalArchives exhibition on the Quit India movement. The Ministry of Culture has decided to convert the Nehru Memorial Museum and Library at Nehru?s official residence ?into a complex showcasing [the] lives of all Indian prime ministers.? This is a mystifying form of equal opportunity eminence that perhaps has few parallels. Imagine if the Lincoln Memorial were to suddenly sprout statues of other luminaries.There are several reasons why Nehru has become a target. TheRSShas long despised him for banning the organisation after Mahatma Gandhi?s assassination and it vehemently disagrees with the form of secularism that he instituted as state practice. It has been easy to rouse public sentiment against Nehru by invoking the humiliating defeat in the 1962 war against China. Nehru?s foreign policy of nonalignment and his faith in state planning have also been questioned. Many also resent his prominence in public life ? for the way theCongresshas appropriated him politically with statues, roads and government programmes named after him, the numerous advertisements in newspapers bearing his image and so on. In some ways, his ubiquity has obscured the detail that makes Nehru great.Rise to greatnessNehru?s life is worth recalling to get a sense as to what he meant to India then and what he offers to the country now. There are fewer biographies of Nehru than he deserves. Part of the reason may have to do with the difficulty in taking on his daunting oeuvre, given how much he wrote and said by way of books, articles, private correspondence and speeches. Historian Judith M. Brown?s excellent 2003 biography, Nehru: A Political Life, is very helpful in that regard. Drawing on existing material and Nehru?s post-1947 papers made available to her by Sonia Gandhi, Brown offers a fascinating, even-handed assessment of his career.Born into a privileged home with a wealthy lawyer and political leader for a father in Motilal Nehru, Jawaharlal grew up around the time when colonial rule was, to paraphrase Brown, challenging India?s religious and social conventions while affording material and political opportunities for educated Indians. Nehru?s political opinions were shaped by his education at Harrow and Cambridge, where he developed a strong distaste for imperialism. After a few desultory years on return, Nehru is drawn to politics, inspired by Gandhi and the protests around 1919-20. The nationalist movement then is marked by debates between moderates and radicals over tactics and strategy, over the use of non-cooperation, questions over pushing for full independence or being content with gradualist approaches.In this fractious climate, Nehru stands by Gandhi and sees him as being central to India?s path to independence, even if the Mahatma?s political approaches and emphasis on moral transformation often frustrate him. Nehru?s outlook is shaped by other factors as well. One, that he grew up in a household marked by Hindu-Muslim cultural mingling; Motilal?s early education from a Muslim tutor was only in Arabic and Persian and being a Kashmiri family in Allahabad, the Nehrus could never really be considered locals and were not prone to narrow, provincial loyalties. Nehru was in some ways always a perennial outsider ? a fierce nationalist who admired Britain culturally, he felt deeply about India?s subjugation under foreign rule but disapproved of its beliefs and customs.Nehru soon became preoccupied with politics andCongressmatters. He also read voraciously. Being in prison a lot helped. In the 23 years from 1921 to 1945 he was sent to jail for nine terms in periods ranging from 12 days to 1041, a total of 3,259 days ? which was nearly nine years of his life. He acclimatised to prison life and wrote of the friendships and hobbies he developed and the irritations of lacking privacy. ?His greatest solace was reading?, Brown writes. He read on politics, economics, science, literature and contemporary affairs. ?Solid reading is a necessity in prison; without it the mind stagnates and rots,? he was to say. In one phase, between February 1934 and September 1935, he read 188 books, averaging 15-20 volumes a month.This no doubt shaped his ownability to produce magical prose, as seen through his own writing in Autobiography and the Discovery of India and the deeply evocative letters and speeches he wrote. Through his years in India and Britain and his travels to Europe and interactions with leaders from other countries, Nehru developed strong convictions about colonial rule, equality within and between nations, the need for land reform and state intervention in the economy and society, the place for science in a nation?s life (as opposed to faith, which he was dismissive of), the need for a greater role for women in nation-building and on India?s place in the world.This form of intellectual development was critical to India?s future as Nehru was to attain prominence in theCongressin the 1930s, including as president of the party, and as the nationalist movement wound through phases of agitation, accommodation, factional division and stasis. Gandhi was ceasing to be a ?serious political leader? in the decade and was focusing his energies on the condition of the ?untouchables? instead. Around 1936, Gandhi was ?publicly proclaiming that Nehru was his heir, and felt that Nehru with his many gifts and total commitment to India rather than to any sectional cause or personal concern was the one who could be relied upon? to achieve unity in theCongress.Nehru was at this stage not only a key player in party deliberations but also a mass leader attracting a good deal of public adulation.As is well-known, Nehru went on head an interim government in 1946 and was the central figure in the negotiations leading up to Partition and independence alongside Lord Mountbatten and M. A. Jinnah. Nehru, who insisted on full independence for India long before Gandhi was prepared to agitate for it, was to vehemently oppose Mountbatten?s proposal to devolve power to the provinces before transferring power ? as that would amount to the Balkanisation of India. Mountbatten recanted but Nehru and his colleagues were to face a range of challenges in the weeks leading to independence, including, as Brown writes, raging communal violence, provincial choices about joining India or Pakistan, the future of the Indian princes, the division of assets of British India and so on.', 'Nehru also had to deal with the crisis in Kashmir soon after ? and the assassination of Gandhi within six months of independence.']",/article/current-affairs/maker-of-modern-india-the-nehru-that-our-country-cannot-forget-118020800247_1.html

Lokur and Deepak Gupta has given leaseholders another month (till March 15, 2018) to manage their affairs and wind up their operations until fresh mining leases and environmental clearances are granted.In doing so, theSupreme Courthas paid a great deal of attention to the process by which the leases were renewed and has questioned the state government and the environment ministry?s actions. Its conclusion? The ?undue haste? in which the state government acted gives the impression that it was ?willing to sacrifice the rule law for the benefit of the mining lease holders?.While the apex court has conceded that the BJP-ruled state government was not obligated at the time to grant new leases through ?the process of competitive bidding or auction?, it has slammed the speed at which the lease renewals were pushed through, even noting that that the ?real intention? of the second renewal was to ?satisfy the avariciousness of the mining lease holders?.From November 2014 to January 12, 2015, the Goa government granted the second renewal of 88 mining leases. These were done partly as a result of its ?Grant of Mining Leases Policy?, which was published on November 4, 2014, and partly because of a Bombay high court order that directed the government to renew 28 mining leases whose stamp duty had already been collected.In 2015, a public interest litigation filed by a non-profit (the Goa Foundation) questioned the second renewal, with senior advocate Prashant Bhushan stating that the state?s policy on renewing leases did not conform to the Supreme Court?s earlier line on ?optimum utilisation of natural resources? and that the leases had been hastily renewed merely a few days before the new mining policy made auction mandatory.TheSupreme Courtcrucially notes that between November 4, 2014 (the date on which the state government?s mining leases policy was uploaded on its website), the state granted a second renewal for 88 mining leases ? with 31 of those leases being granted on one day, January 12, 2015.Why is the date of January 12, 2015 significant? As the court notes, it was the day that the Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Amendment Ordinance, 2015 came into force. The amendment mandated, for most cases, the process of competitive bidding and auctioning while granting mining leases.TheSupreme Courttakes careful notice of this timeline (November 4, 2014 to January 12, 2015) and states:??the ?Grant of Mining Leases Policy? as published on 4th November, 2014 was not a final policy statement but only an intent that would take final shape after due vetting. The Grant of Mining Leases Policy was eventually published on 20th January, 2015 but it was acted upon even before it was gazetted.A partial explanation for this hurry, if we may venture to suggest, is that the State of Goa was aware (like everybody else) on 17th November, 2014 if not earlier, of the policy of the Government of India to auction the grant of mining leases which policy was made available in the public domain on that date and suggestions invited.?As the court?s judgement notes, the introduction of Section 10B by way of an amendment to the MMDR Act, made it ?very clear that if it were to be accepted, auction of mining leases in respect of notified minerals would become a reality if not an obligation?.?It appears that to circumvent this rather uncomfortable policy, the state pressed the accelerator on the renewal of mining leases from December 2014 onward to benefit mining lease holders. So much so that in respect of five mining leases, the state overstepped the law and granted a second renewal in early January 2015 to some entities without even waiting for any approval or deemed approval of the mining plan from the Indian Bureau of Mines or any other authority,? the judgement notes.Crucially, the court also notes at one point that of the 88 mining leases that were renewed, 38 of them ?were not working for a variety of reasons?, thus making their renewal nothing but an ?empty exercise?.The table above shows that from January 5, 2015 to January 12, 2015, the Goa government granted the second renewal to as many as 56 mining leases.TheSupreme Courtnotes that this ?sudden spur of renewal of mining leases is beyond comprehension?.Importantly, the apex court notes that the Bombay high court?s 2014 order can?t be used as a justification for the haste. ?The judgment and order of the High Court in Lithoferro cannot be used as a shield for explaining the haste,? the order states.Goa government?s defenceHow did the state government defend itself? The order notes that the state appears to have taken the view challenging the decision of the high court would have delayed the commencement of mining operations and that because it was ?virtually starved of funds on account of stoppage of mining operations?, it decided to grant a second renewal of mining leases rather than opting for the grant of fresh leases.The court, on the other hand, doesn?t wholly buy this defence, noting that the urgency exhibited by the state was ?motivated rather than genuine?. As it points out:The very large number of renewals granted over a comparatively brief period is a clear indication that the State did not have ?mineral development? in mind but had some other non-statutory interests while taking its decision to grant a second renewal to the mining leases.', 'The haste with which the State took its decision also needs to be understood in the background of the fact that mining had been suspended by the State in September 2012 that is more than two years prior to the grant of second renewals. The urgency suddenly exhibited by the State therefore seems to be make-believe and motivated rather than genuine.']",/article/current-affairs/how-goa-hastily-pushed-through-2nd-renewal-of-mining-leases-sc-reveals-118020800233_1.html

So perhaps the answer to antibiotic resistance is under our feet.', 'Like humans, the more than12,000 speciesof ants are all highly social. This behaviour increases the chance that they come into to contact with germs. Comparable to our towns and cities, ant colonies take communal living to the next level, with up to tens of millions of individuals cohabiting in a single nest.', 'Colony survival depends on worker ants going out into the environment to collect food. Workers return to their densely inhabited nests loaded with food, but alsoharmful microbes.Returning workers then share their food and their germs through mouth-to-mouth feeding ? essentially vomitinginto each other?s mouths.', 'If this wasn?t enough, the warm, moist conditions inants? nestsmake them ideal nurseries for disease-causing microbes. Finally, the members of almost all ants in a colony are related, so if one ant is susceptible to a germ,it is likely that many others will be, too.', 'Despite this longstanding threat of disease, ants are incredibly successful creatures. They dominate some environments and have diversified into thousands of species over150m years of evolution. This suggests ants have found ways to deal with the high threat of disease. So what can we learn from them?How ants deal with disease', 'Scientists have found that ants use a number of tricks to limit disease. Like humans, ants are exceptional cleaners. Many species have efficient waste-removal systems, ensuring diseased waste (including dead ants) isremoved from the nest or contained in special chambers. They also regularly clean themselves and each other, and group together todisinfect contaminated ants.But even with good hygiene habits, disease can still be an issue.', 'Ants have evolved ways around this by using their own form of medicine. For example, some ants, when infected, eat toxins such as hydrogen peroxideto fight disease. Others collect conifer resin, which they incorporate into their nestsas a preventative measure. Some species of ant are able to produce formic acid, which combines with the resin to form apotent antimicrobialagent.', 'We also know that ants also produce their own antimicrobialsin bodily secretions. Now researchers have tried to work out what affects how these chemicals are made. In a new study published in the journalRoyal Society Open Science, researchers from Arizona State University investigated the antimicrobial activity of 20 ant species in the US living in nests with between 80 and 220,000 inhabitants.', 'The researchers predicted that larger nest species would produce more effective antimicrobials, because of a greater risk of coming into contact with disease. Testing external secretions againstStaphylococcus epidermidis, a common bacterium not known to cause disease, showed that 60% of the ant species produced secretions with antimicrobial activity. But, surprisingly, 40% didn?t produce an antimicrobial that could kill the bacterium.', 'What?s more, species in larger colonies were no more likely to have antimicrobial activity than small colonies. This is surprising as it is generally thought that disease is more likely to be spread in larger colonies. The authors suggest that the 40% of ants without antimicrobial activity have other methods of controlling the spread of bacteria. But we also don?t know if these 40% produce antimicrobial agents that work against other microbes.Antibiotics for the future?', 'This adds to the idea that ants could well be a good source of new antibiotics. Not only do ants produce their own antimicrobial agents, but they can also encourage other beneficial microbes to grow. For example, researchers recently discovered a bacterium living among one ant species that produces compounds capable of killing harmful bacteriaresistant to conventional antibiotics, including the common superbug MRSA.', 'Millions of years of evolution in a high-risk environment have made ants a potential source of vital antimicrobials. These substances still need to be turned into effectivedrugsand then trialled in humans. But the more we learn about the strategies ants use to fight disease, the more likely we are to uncover new ways to deal with the threat of resistant bacteria and disease.', 'Charlie Durant, PhD Candidate, Department of Genetics and Genome Biology,University of LeicesterandRob Hammond, Lecturer, Department of Genetics and Genome Biology,University of Leicester', 'This article was originally published onThe Conversation.

There?s a lot going on here.', 'There?s an element of performing excessive wealth by wasting it. Giving up such an expensive car (a new model costs US$200,000) could be seen as a sacrifice for space, but it?s also like burning $100 notes to show how how little they mean.', 'In the 1960s, anthropologistVictor Turnerargued that symbols can encompass two contradictory meanings at the same time. Thus, the sports car in orbit symbolises both life and death. Through the body of the car, Musk is immortalised in the vacuum of space. The car is also an armour against dying, a talisman that quells a profound fear of mortality.', 'Thespacesuitis also about death. It?s the essence of the uncanny: the human simulacrum, something familiar that causes uneasiness, or even a sense of horror. The Starman was never alive, but now he?s haunting space.', 'In a similar vein, the red sports car symbolises masculinity - power, wealth and speed - but also how fragile masculinity is.

Or at least on avery wild ride.', 'Global stockmarketsplunged on Feb. 5, continuing the already precipitous decline from the week before. TheDow Jonesindustrial average, one of the most widely followed indexes, fell by almost1,200 points, a 4.6 percent loss and thebiggest point declineon record. Put another way, the world?s 500 richest peoplelost about US$114 billionin a single day.', 'Since the Dow?s recordpeak of 26,617on Jan. 26, the index has fallen almost 9 percent. This brings it close to what is known as a ?correction,? which is often described as a fall of 10 percent. Corrections are simply a large enough fall in stock prices to get some people to believe the market?s upward trajectory has stopped. We?ll be in a ?bear? market if losses reach 20 percent.', 'What does this mean for investors and the rest of us? In my view, there are three important ideas to keep in mind as we assess the impact of a plunging stock market on the economy and our wallets.Don?t panic', 'First, the stock market often makes very dramatic moves in a short period of time, and extreme volatility like Monday?s occasionally occurs. One of the most famous market plunges occurred in 1929, at the start of the Great Depression.', 'On Oct. 25 1929, a Friday, theDow Jonesindustrial average closed at 301. The following Monday, dubbed ?Black Monday? in trading lore, the Dow closed at 260, a drop of 13.5 percent. Then the next day, called ?Black Tuesday,? the Dow fell to 230 points, a loss of 11.7 percent.', 'People were in a panic after only two days of steep losses. On Wednesday, which has no moniker, the Dow reversed course and rose up to 259. This rise almost entirely wiped out the previous day?s fall.', 'In other words, in the space of less than 36 hours, the Dow fell and then rose around 12 percent. This whipsaw action means the stock market is not a place for investors who are faint of heart ? and many people?s savings and investments were wiped out as a result. But it also means that just because the stock market has large losses today does not means these large losses won?t be quickly reversed in the future. (Perhaps even as you read this article, the market is going up again.)Main Street vs. Wall Street', 'Second, Wall Street does not directly affect Main Street.', 'Falling or rising stock prices, even when the market changes dramatically, typically do not have a large or immediate effect on sales at stores, restaurants or other retailers. One reason for this is that people spend only a portion of their wealth each year.', 'Few people pay current bills and expenses from their stock market accounts. Instead, most people base their day-to-day spending decisions on their paycheck and other sources of income, not on their stock market holdings. Instead, stocks are often held to achieve long-term goals like retirement, a child?s or grandchild?s education, or a place to store money until needed to make a major purchase.', 'Moreover, when wealth increases, like when the stock market or housing market rises in value, people oftenspendonly a fraction of that.', 'When wealth decreases, many people don?t cut back their purchases on a dollar-for-dollar basis.', 'Economists call this change in spending the ?marginal propensity to consume out of wealth,? and many believe the change in spending is around 4 percent of the total change in wealth. This means that whenever the value of people?s stock market holding goes up or down, spending at stores, restaurants and other retailers changes by only a small fraction.', 'The 4 percent spending figure might even be too high. Research byJames Poterba and Andrew Samwickfrom the mid-1990s investigated what happened when the stock market went up, and they found ?little evidence that luxury spending rises in the wake of rising stock prices.? Since othereconomic researchsuggests the 4 percent figure might be too low, it is likely the figure is about right.Relatively few own stock', 'The third idea to understand is that any dramatic drop or rise in the stock market affects relatively few people in the US Many families have no savings, and, among those that have saved, not all have invested in the stock market.', 'Every three years, theFederal Reservesurveys thousands of American families about their finances. The effort is called theSurvey of Consumer Finances. Itslatest datashow that just 14 percent of all U. S. families directly own shares or stock mutual funds.', 'So if you?re one of those 14 percent, Warren Buffett, for example, you care a great deal ?he lost $5.1 billionon Feb. 5 alone. But for the other 86 percent, the daily fluctuations don?t matter quite as much since they don?t have a direct stake in the outcome.', 'Moreover, the amount of money invested by this select group of families that directly own stocks is quite low. Half of all families who directly invested in the stock market has $25,000 or less. That is not to say that everyone who invests socks away only a small amount. In recent days, the wealth of a small group took a significant hit, with the wealthiestlosing about $250 billionsince last week.', 'It is also important to note that some people who don?t directly own stocks are still affected by the market?s performance. Pensions and money stored in retirement accounts experience the market?s ups and downs, so some retirees? income is affected.About 37 percent of U. S. stockswere held in retirement accounts in 2015, a sharp rise from the recent past.', 'However, changes in future retirement income typically don?t affect spending today. Also, some people have options to buy their company?s stock in the future. While many of these options lost value recently, most people could not have spent the money from these options until years in the future.What,meworry?', 'What all this means is that the next time you hear that the stock market has set a new record low, or even a record high, know that it only affects a small proportion of Americans.', 'Among the families that are directly affected, the average will likely change its spending habits by only a little bit. Amazon?s Jeff Bezos, for one, is unlikely to change his lifestyle much just becausehe lost $3.26 billionin a day ? as he still has $116 billion to spare.', 'Finally, a plunge today does not rule out a dramatic rise in the future.', 'Cratering stocks makes big news. However, like many headline news stories, there is only a small chance the news of a single-day plunge in stock values will have an immediate and direct impact on your life.', 'This an updated version of an article originally published on Aug. 24, 2015.', 'Jay L.

The most important thing about this reusable spacecraft is that it can carry a payload equivalent to sending five double-decker London buses into space ? which will be invaluable for future manned space exploration or in sending bigger satellites into orbit.', 'Falcon Heavyessentially comprises three previously tested rockets strapped together to create one giant spacecraft. The launch drew massiveinternationalaudiences ? but while it was an amazing event to witness, there are some important potential drawbacks that must be considered as we assess the impact of this mission on space exploration.', 'But let?s start by looking at some of the many positives.Falcon Heavyis capable of taking 68 tonnes of equipment into orbit close to the Earth. The current closest competitor is theDelta IV heavywhich has a payload equivalent of 29 tonnes. So Falcon Heavy represents a big step forward in delivering ever larger satellites or manned missions out to explore our solar system. For the purposes ofcolonising Marsor the moon, this is a welcome and necessary development.', 'The launch itself, the views from the payload and the landing of the booster rocketscan only be described as stunning. Thechosen payloadwas a Tesla Roadster vehicle belonging to Space X founder and CEOElon Musk? with a dummy named ?Starman? sitting in the driver?s seat along with plenty of cameras.', 'This sort of launch spectacle gives a much needed public engagement boost to the space industry that has not been seen since the time of the space race in the 1960s. As a side effect this camera feed from the payload also providedyet another proof that the Earth is not flat? a subject about which Musk haspreviously been vocal.', 'The fact that this is a fully reusable rocket is also an exciting development. While vehicles such as the Space Shuttle have been reusable, their launch vehicles have not. That means their launches resulted in a lot of rocket boosters and main fuel tanks either burning up in the atmosphere orsitting on the bottom of the ocean(some are recovered).', 'This recovery massively reduces the launch cost for both exploration and scientific discovery. TheFalcon Heavyhas been promoted as providing a cost of roughly US$1,300 per kg of payload, while the space shuttle costapproximately US$60,000 per kg. The impact this price drop has for innovative new space products and research is groundbreaking. The rocket boosters on this test flight had a controlled and breathtakingly simultaneous landing onto the launch pad.', 'So what could possibly be wrong with this groundbreaking test flight? While visually appealing, cheaper and a major technological advancement, what about the environmental impact? The rocket is reusable, which means cutting down the resources required for the metal body of the rocket. However, the mass of most rockets are more than 95% fuel. Building bigger rockets with bigger payloads means more fuel is used for each launch.', 'The current fuel forFalcon HeavyisRP-1(a refined kerosene) and liquid oxygen, which creates a lot of carbon dioxide when burnt.', 'The amount of kerosene in three Falcon 9 rocketsis roughly 440 tonnesand RP-1 has a34% carbon content. This amount of carbon is a drop in the ocean compared to global industrial emissions as a whole, but if the SpaceX?splan for a rocket launch every two weekscomes to fruition, this amount of carbon (approximately 4,000 tonnes per year) will rapidly become a bigger problem.', 'The car test payload is also something of an issue. The vehicle has been scheduled to head towards Mars, but what has not been made clear is what is going to happen to it afterwards. Every modern space mission is required to think about clearing up after itself. In the cases of planetary or lunar satellites this inevitably results in either a controlledburn-up in the atmosphere, or a directimpact with the body they orbit.', 'Space debris is rapidly becomingone of the biggest problemswe face ? there are more than 150m objects that need tracking to ensure as few collisions with working spacecraft as possible. The result of any impact or degradation of the car near Mars could start creating debris at the red planet, meaning that the pollution of another planet has already begun.', 'However, current reports suggest that the rocket may have overshot its trajectory, meaning the vehicle will head towards theasteroid belt rather than Mars. This is probably going to mean a collision is inevitable. The scattering of tiny fragments of an electric vehicle is pollution at the minimum ? and a safety hazard for future missions at worst. Where these fragments end up will be hard to predict ? and hence troublesome for future satellite launches to Mars, Saturn or Jupiter. The debris could be drawn by the gravity of Mars, asteroids or even swept away with the solar wind.', 'What is also unclear is whether the car was built in a perfect clean room. If not there is the risk that bacteria from Earth may spread through the solar system after a collision. This would be extremely serious, given that we are currently planning to search for life on neighbouring bodies such as Mars and Jupiter?s moon Europa. If microorganisms were found there we may never know whether they actually came from Earth in the first place.', 'Of course, these issues don?t affect my sense of excitement and wonder at watching the amazing launch. The potential advantages of this large-scale rocket are incredible, but private space firms must also be aware that the potential negative impacts (both in space and on Earth) are just as large.', 'Ian Whittaker, Lecturer,Nottingham Trent University', 'This article was originally published onThe Conversation.

These are EB-1 to EB-5.EB-1 visas are green cards for people with ""extraordinary"" abilities that have ""been demonstrated by sustained national orinternationalacclaim"", ""outstanding"" professors and researchers who are ""recognised internationally as outstanding in a specific academic area"" and multinational executives.About 40,000 EB-1 visas are available each year.EB-2 category provides around 40,000 green cards annually to professionals such as architects, lawyers, doctors, teachers and engineers with advanced degrees.The category also includes immigrants ""who because of their exceptional ability in the sciences, arts, or business"" will ""substantially benefit"" the ""economy, cultural or educational interests, or welfare"" of the United States.EB-3 visas are for skilled and unskilled workers providing services that are not available from US workers, and for professionals such as engineers and teachers who do not have advanced degrees.Most of the Indian skilled immigrants apply for green cards in this category, thus the reason for their long agonising wait.Every year, the US issues about 10,000 green cards under EB-4 visas category, which are available for people such as religious workers, broadcasters, members of the armed services and Afghani and Iraqi translators.There are around 10,000 green cards available for immigrants under EB-5 category who invest at least $500,000 in certain US businesses.In addition to the employment-based green card programmes that allow people to live permanently in the US, there are around 20 visa programmes that allow people to live temporarily in the US for employment reasons.Some of the better-known categories of these temporary employment-based visas include H-2A visas for temporary or seasonal agriculture workers and H-2B visas for temporary or seasonal non-agricultural workers like hotel employees in seasonal tourist destinations.""Another significant category is H-1B visas for workers in occupations requiring the application of highly specialised knowledge, such as information technology and engineering,"" the report said.""In 2016, about 530,000 people got H-1B, H-2A, and H-2B visas, including spouses and children.

They were brimming with confidence. Thehome-rental companyhad exceeded financial projections for 2017, with $93 million in profit on $2.6 billion in revenue, said people with knowledge of the matter.Airbnbwas ready, by some employees\' estimations, to begin the process to go public.But the boss had another view. Brian Chesky, the 36-year-old co-founder and chief executive officer, privately informed his financial chief, Laurence Tosi, thatAirbnbwouldn?t initiate an initial public offering this year, the people said. The news came as a surprise to Tosi. He had been discussing the prospect with major investors before transitioning to a larger role beyond finance.Chesky made it clear that things wouldn\'t go as Tosi wanted. Chesky said he would promote Belinda Johnson, who was running business affairs and legal, to chief operating officer. Tosi had expected to get the COO job after Airbnb\'s public offering. He\'d struggled to work with Johnson in the past, and some insiders viewed the move as a way to force Tosi\'s departure. Accounts differ on whether Chesky then asked Tosi for his resignation, but by the end of the meeting, the CFO was out.Chesky has been unapologetic about his ambitions to keepAirbnbprivate for now. ""I know people will ask what these changes mean for a potentialIPO.Let me address this directly. We are not going public in 2018,"" Chesky said in a statement announcing Johnson?s promotion and Tosi\'s departure on Thursday. ""We will make decisions about going public on our own timetable.""Tosi declined to comment. Nick Papas, a spokesman for Airbnb, disputed that Chesky and Tosi discussed theIPOtimeline last week. ""The senior leadership and board of the company has been aligned, and the company has never had plans to go public in 2018,"" Papas wrote in an email.Although the two men had many feuds, the question of when to sell shares to the public was a recurring point of contention between Chesky and Tosi. Four prominent backers ? General Atlantic, Glade Brook Capital, Technology Crossover Ventures and TPG ? supported Tosi\'s plan to begin the listing process by drafting paperwork as soon as next month, according to emails reviewed by Bloomberg and people familiar with the matter. These firms also encouraged the prospect of him taking a more influential role at the company, the people said.Tosi, the former CFO at Blackstone Group who turns 50 on Thursday, never fit in at Airbnb, according to interviews with more than a dozen executives, employees and investors, who asked not to be identified discussing private matters. While tensions between Chesky and Tosi have been widely reported by technology website the Information and elsewhere, the company\'s financial results, clashes over Airbnb\'sIPOtimeline and Tosi\'s differences with other executives including Johnson haven\'t been previously reported. People with knowledge of the matter also outlined, for the first time, Tosi\'s creation of a hedge fund insideAirbnband his opposition to a proposed late 2017 investment from Japanese investor SoftBank Group Corp.The addition of Tosi in 2015 was a signal for Wall Street to pay attention to the company. He was eager to create new, cash-generating ventures at Airbnb, people familiar with his work said. He quietly built a hedge fund within the company\'s finance department. He used a portion of capital from the balance sheet to buy stocks, currencies and fixed-income securities, mimicking the treasury fund he ran at Blackstone. The side project represented 30 percent of the company\'s cash flow last year and made about $5 million a month for Airbnb, the people said.But Chesky and his lieutenants had grown frustrated with Tosi, who they believed was too brash and not a fit for Airbnb\'s wide-eyed, congenial culture, said people with knowledge of their thinking.BloombergTosi exhibited an alpha temperament, constantly interrupting and sometimes talking over colleagues in meetings, one of the people said. Chesky and Tosi disagreed over matters big and small. A persistent philosophical debate revolved around Tosi\'s desire to buy companies, while Chesky preferred to build products in-house. In December, Tosi was leading discussions with TripAdvisor Inc to purchase its home-rental business, Flip Key, until Chesky decided to back out of a deal, a person familiar with the talks said.', ""Another person said Chesky never took the acquisition proposal seriously and didn't meet with TripAdvisor's CEO.

We started the year 2017 with 11 topnotch products. The next step is increasing the dealer network in the cities where we see growth and bringing products, our entry-level G 310 R and G 310 GS and the new mid-segment of the F 750 GS and F 850 GS. .BMW is more known as motorcycle brand, whereas India is moving more towardsmore scooters.How are you going to position yourself?It depends on the market needs. For us, the maxi scooters we launched a couple of years ago is a clear step into urban mobility. Urban mobility in the future will become more important. Apart from our big scooters, this year we will launch a mid-segment scooter with a 350 CC engine.If customer demand on scooters is picking up, we will definitely bring them to India."", 'We have flexible production plans.

Butterbur is available in pharmacies mainly in the form of ready-to-use tablets. Follow the dosage prescribed by the manufacturer.Yarrow (Achillea millefolium) -The yarrow is a plant that has a sedative effect on the uterus and ovaries and thus calms spasms.

Infuse 40 grams of dry leaves in one litre of hot water for 10 minutes. Then drink 3 large cups of this tea a day between meals during the entire period of menstruation.Massage the reflex zone-By massaging the plantar reflex zone of the ovaries and that of the uterus, blood circulation and cellular exchanges in these organs are intensified. These reflex zones are located on either side of the heel, between the malleolus and the back of the heel. Massage the reflex zones of one foot for 5 to 10 minutes, and then proceed in the same way on the other foot.""]",/article/health/natural-remedies-for-painful-menstruation-118020800365_1.html

According to figures provided in Parliament by minister of state for civil aviation Jayant Sinha, the state-owned carrier registered alossof Rs 57.65 billion in FY17, Rs 19.29 billion higher than Rs 38.36 billionlossin FY16.The figures reflect significant deviation from the minister?s own parliamentary disclosure on July 27, 2017. Sinha had then said that Air India?s provisionallossfor FY17 was Rs 37.28 billion ? almost Rs 20 billion less than the actual figure.Questions sent to Sinha?s office didn?t elicit any response till the time of going to press.SeniorAir Indiaofficials said the inflation in losses is likely due to certain non-disclosures by the company in the provisional figures. ?The original provisional figures were of conservative estimate. The new figures include additional provisioning arising out of the Dharmadhikari Report and demands from Serve from India Scheme (SFIS), which can no longer be utilised as the scrips have expired,? he said.Total claim from SFISs amount to Rs 11,551.50 million.This raises questions about the company?s accounting policy, as SFIS claims for airlines were discontinued by the government from January 2011. In fact, during its audit of the airline?s account books of FY15, the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) had pointed out this fact, saying that government clearance was necessary for renewal of expired scrip and issuance of scrips, which was not available with the company. ?Hence, necessary provision should have been made for the expired and unapproved SFIS scrip claim amounting to Rs 11,551.5 million. However, this has not been done.', 'Therefore, thelossof the company stands understated,? theCAGwrote.The audit highlighted 14 instances where proper accounting process was not followed. Seven of them state that the airline had not followed the prescribed accounting standards; five are on non-provision of amounts as mandated by accounting standards; one qualification was on a change in accounting policy on inventory and one on certain balances not being reconciled.The airline?s accounting process also came under scrutiny recently when Civil Aviation MinisterAshok Gajapathi Rajusaid that company?s debt could turn out to be 40 per cent higher than previously expected, as the airline?s books have not been evaluated properly. ?When our exercise of calculating Air India?s debt began, we found that the sum was hovering around the Rs 50,000 crore (Rs 500 billion) mark. But I won?t be surprised if the total debt reaches Rs 70,000 crore (Rs 700 billion). Since people are looking at the books carefully, they may find more,? the minister had said.The new figures contradict the government?s claim that the debt-laden airline was making a turnaround. In fact, Prime Minister Narendra Modi in his Independence Day speech had said: ""Air Indiawas notorious for incurring losses.

He also said that the Budget, in these challenging times, provided Rs 120 billion relief to the middle class, including pensioners and senior citizens.Wondering at the analysis over the announcement of the tax spooking the market, he said the market movement was due to global cues. ?Was the tax also responsible for a fall in Dow Jones?? he asked.The FM?s reply to a general debate on the Budget for 2018-19 saw heated exchanges between the treasury benches and the Opposition in the Lok Sabha, particularly the Congress, over the Rafale deal.While Jaitley said the break-up of the deal could not be provided due to security reasons and cited the replies by defence minister of the previous United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government to such questions to buttress his point of view, the Congress members said they never demanded segment-wise details of the deal.In his speech in the Lok Sabha, Jaitley said it was the Narendra Modi government that took the difficult decisions of demonetisation, the goods and services tax (GST) and the imposition of theLTCG tax.?We know how to bite the bullet when tough decisions are to be taken,? he said.He said the previous UPA government did not undertake even one single structural reform.In the Rajya Sabha where the FM is scheduled to reply to a discussion on Friday, senior Congress leader PChidambaraminitiated the debate. Friday is the last day of the first half of the Budget session before it goes into a month-long recess to meet again in March.Initiating the discussion on the Budget in the Rajya Sabha,Chidambarampunched holes in the government?s claim on creation of jobs and promises to increase the minimum support prices (MSP) and provide health insurance to 500 million people.Chidambaram, a former FM, complimented Chief Economic Advisor (CEA) Arvind Subramanian for a well-researched Economic Survey, but bemoaned that the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government had failed to address the three challenges facing the country, which the Survey had also identified: Education and health, unemployment, and agriculture.The Congress leader, who went hoarse in his effort to be heard over the din of incessant sloganeering by the Bharatiya Janata Party members during the entire length of his 40-minute speech, termed the government?s economic policy a ?betrayal?. He said all norms of fiscal prudence had been thrown out the window.Chidambaramcomplimented the CEA as a ?good doctor? for producing a well-researched Economic Survey. He said that while the CEA was a good doctor, ?the patient was a terrible one?.Chidambaramsaid it was disappointing that the FM did not heed the CEA?s diagnosis.The Congress leader said the FM should have said the patient was very ill, may be terminally ill and this was the diagnosis, but he had failed. He said the government was going to leave behind a limping economy.Chidambaramalso asked 12 questions on the Budget numbers. On the government?s direct and indirect tax proposals,Chidambaramsaid the government?s ?taxation philosophy was to burden the people with indirect taxes? and benefit the rich.He described the Budget announcements on MSP for farmers, job creation, and the ambitious health assurance scheme as jumlas, or rhetoric. ?We support the triple talaq Bill, but not these triple jumlas,? he said. The former FM asked whether the government would cut the excise duty on petrol and diesel if global crude prices were to rise.Reiterating that the government loses Rs 3.7 trillion since long-term capital gains are not taxed, Jaitley said only the wealthiest would be taxed since those making capital gains of Rs 100,000 would be exempted.', 'The wealthiest class included large corporates, limited liability partnerships, and foreign institutional investors, he said.Times were different when theLTCG taxwas withdrawn since money in stock markets used to come from Mauritius and Cyprus. Now, India had revised treaties with them, he said, providing rationale for the imposition of theLTCG tax.Jaitley took on the Opposition for saying that the GST was introduced in haste. He reminded them that the Constitution Amendment Bill, passed by Parliament, had made it mandatory for the Centre and the states to introduce the new indirect tax regime by September 1, 2017. Or else they could not have had the earlier tax system.Asserting that structural reforms such as demonetisation and the GST had thrown up short-term challenges, but had medium and long-term benefits for the economy, he said India?s gross domestic growth lagged the fastest-growing economy, China, by a couple of decimal points this year. ?Next two years we will be back as the fastest-growing major economy, according to International Monetary Fund estimates,? he said.Unlike the UPA regime, the NDA government had brought down inflation and the Centre?s fiscal deficit, he said. The fiscal deficit slippage by 0.3 percentage points in the current financial year was largely due to the statistical reason of the GST yielding only eight months? revenue rather than nine months, he added.Jaitley said while the Congress had imposed 31 per cent indirect taxes (combination of central and state taxes), it was opposing the 28 per cent GST. He defended the different GST rates, saying necessities and luxury goods could not have the same rates. ?I went to Singapore and saw that there is a 7 per cent rate on both Mercedes and food items. India cannot afford that kind of system,? he said.Jaitley said he failed to understand why the Congress was opposing Aadhaar, when it was conceived by the UPA. ?You brought the draft law which was silent about the purposes of Aadhaar,? he told the Congress benches. Aadhaar would help the government identify the poor and target subsidies, he said.']",/article/economy-policy/we-bite-the-bullet-on-difficult-decisions-fm-jaitley-on-ltcg-tax-118020801534_1.html

The contribution of the US in its overall turnover has been growing steadily at a time when most of its peers saw the share of US business shrink in their turnovers -- it grew from 43 per cent in the first quarter of the 2017-18 fiscal to 48 per cent now. The company expects the contribution of US to rise to 60 per cent of its turnover by 2019-20.This would be the highest among its peers. The other two pharma majors who draw significant revenues from the US -- Dr Reddy\'s Laboratories and Aurobindo --- have business from that country account for 45 per cent and 44 per cent of their toplines at present.India\'s most valuable drug maker, Sun Pharma, has seen the contribution of US business in its overall revenue shrink to 30 per cent in Q2FY18 from a 50 per cent about a year back. Cipla, the second most valuable Indian pharma company, draws only 15 per cent of its revenues from the US market compared to 40 per cent for most of the larger peers. Similarly,Torrent Pharmasaw the share of US business in its revenues shrink from 40 per cent in FY16 to 23 per cent in FY17 and analysts expect this would further contract to 18 per cent in FY18.In fact, data show that the share of US business in overall turnover had shrunk from 44 per cent in H1FY17 to 38.8 per cent in H1FY18 forBig Pharmain India.A senior official ofCadila Healthcare(also known as Zydus Cadila) claimed that the price erosion of the base business in the US is bottoming out and in the third quarter it was at 4 per cent. ""We expect the price erosion in US base business to be in low single digits as it is bottoming out together with volume growth in the base business. The fourth quarter would see around 10-12 new product launches in the US and this would continue for the upcoming quarters. On the whole, we expect, the share of US to rise in our overall revenue - from a roughly 50 per cent now to 55 per cent in FY19 and the US would contribute around 60 per cent of our revenues by FY20,"" he elaborated wishing to remain anonymous.Edelweiss felt that the company has a clear roadmap for its US business - it has already received the highest number of US Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) approvals (78 including tentative approvals) since April 2017 and it aims to launch 75 per cent of these.', 'It has launched nine products in the first nine months of FY18 and aims to file at least 30-40 products every year going forward. Malik said thatCadila Healthcareis expected to launch 150 products in the next two years. It has a pipeline of 157 abbreviated new drug applications (ANDAs) pending approval.The 2017-18 dream run can be attributed to getting the approval for blockbuster drug forulcerative colitis(genericLialdathat has a market size of $1.5 bn in the US) in the first quarter of the year itself. Zydus was quick to launch genericLialda(with a 180-day exclusivity period) in the second quarter itself and saw its US revenues soar 66 per cent. The company received 32 product approvals during the second quarter including one for inflammatory bowel disease drug Asacol HD (market size of $400 mn).Lialdahas been the big launch for Cadila this fiscal -- analysts expect 40 per cent of the FY18 profits to come from the drug which would taper down to 20 per cent of profits in FY19 as competition for the drug increases in the US.

This leads to lowering of their value and difficulties in clearing the strict phytosanitary norms imposed by European and other countries.The extent of processing of agriculture products differs with different methodologies used.According to an official report onDoubling Farmers Income(DFI), the extent of food processing is highest amongfoodgrainsat almost 70 per cent, while in fisheries it is only 26 per cent and 35 per cent in milk.Buffalo meatis processed to about 20 per cent, followed bypoultry(6 per cent), while processing of fruits and vegetables is very low at 2.2 per cent.?Expanding one acre of land under high-value crops such ashorticultureat the expense of staple crops (cerealsand pulses) yields an additional gross returns up to Rs 101,608 per hectare,? the report on Doubling Incomes said.At the all-India level, the proportion of production that farmers are not able to sell in the market and thus do not get a monetary return for is 34 per cent, 44.6 per cent, and 40 per cent for fruits, vegetables, and fruits and vegetables combined respectively, the report said.Clearly, this a huge quantum, given that India produced about 305 million tonnes of fruits and vegetables in 2017-18.Assuming that 3-4 per cent of the production is retained by the farmer for self-consumption and seeds, the unsold fruit and vegetable output would be as much as 36 per cent.In value terms this could mean millions of rupees lost due to sheer inability to process.?Proper value addition of agriculture produce could lower the demand for a hike in minimum support price,? Ashish Mittal of All India Kisan Mazdoor Sangh told Business Standard.Prof Sukhpal Singh from the Centre For Management in Agriculture at the Indian Institute of Management?Ahmedabad (IIM-A), said that value addition in Indian agriculture is challenging as domestic consumption is huge, while at the same time, Indian products don\'t meet global standards, especially phytosanitary norms.Ha said the markets in India do not permit value-addition of food as it is highly costly for consumers.?So there is dual challenge of not getting the right buyers in domestic markets who are willing to purchase high-priced products, while international markets have stringent quality standards that farm goods often aren\'t able to meet,? Singh told Business Standard.""All this makes me feel that instead of focusing on processd food we should concentrate more on selling fresh farm items and develop basic processing facilities on the farms itself, like grading, packaging and sorting,? Singh said.This itself would solve a big problem and help farmers get better prices for good produce, which is also a value addition.?In India post-harvest losses are not as precisely quantified as in other countries.', 'It is more of value loss like someone buying poor quality products.

His opponent in exile, the pro-Indian former PresidentMohamed Nasheedhasasked Delhito ?act soon, and to act firmly.?Indiasent paratroopers in 1988 to counter a coup and analysts are currently advising Delhi not to rule out military options.That might not be so easy to venture into. The geopolitical stakes, for one, are very different now.Chinawas not a major factor in India's considerations in 1988. Beijing was then hiding its strengths and biding its time but PresidentXi Jinpingnow wantsChinato be at the centre stage in world affairs and to that end has assiduously cultivatedMaldivesin recent years.Xi Jinpingwent to Male before he arrived inIndiain September 2014. Yameen has obliged by pushing through a free trade agreement in Parliament and inviting Chinese participation in key infrastructure projects. A section of the Maldivian political elite is very invested in ties with Beijing. In the words of Nasheed, ?piece by piece, island by island, theMaldivesis being sold off toChina.?Chinawill thus want to use the crisis to preserve its gains and test India's resolve in theIndian Ocean.It has plenty incentive to do so. Beijing doesn?t believe theIndian Oceanshould be named afterIndia.It disapproves of India-US efforts to balanceChinaand the characterisation of the region as Indo-Pacific by US Secretary of StateRex Tillerson.The current crisis inMaldivesisn?t just another fracas between political factions in a tiny nation ? instead the archipelago has become a site where two Asian powers are jostling for strategic advantage in theIndian Ocean.The crisis has, after Doklam, turned into another challenge for India's own Monroe Doctrine, which expects other powers not to exercise undue influence in its own backyard. There are reputations at stake; other powers in the region will keenly watch India?s handling of the crisis whileChinagoes about its machinations.There are several risk factors that militate against military intervention. First, there is the fate of Indian nationals to consider. China, which has already spoken of respecting Maldives? sovereignty and the principle of non-interference, may react in unanticipated ways, especially if Yameen or other leaders were to seek its help explicitly. Beijing could allowIndiato have its way inMaldivesnow and open up another battle of attrition elsewhere.Indiaclearly has few good options on the table."", ""The only hope over the medium term is to work towards making Maldivian opinion favourable towardsIndia.There are, however, complications on that score.Indiahas tried to engage Yameen but it clearly prefers Nasheed to the former. And this is where the BJP's anti-Muslim politics can be a liability forIndiawhen trying to shape outcomes in theMaldives.The reason this is so is because Yameen has used religion as an instrument of mobilisation and can easily rally anti-Indiasentiment on the basis of BJP's anti-Muslim policies, should Delhi take a sterner approach towards his regime. Critics might contend that India's loss of leverage in theMaldivesis a matter of state competence but cultural factors count too when it comes to assessing loss of influence.

If inflation is up, the government may soonstart raising interest ratesto contain it. And when interest rates increase, this reduces the return investors get on stocks, making them less desirable ? hence the sell-off. This means that, historically, when interest rates rise,stock prices tend to decrease.', 'Butmarketsdo not only follow economic reasoning. They also follow human emotions and out-of-control algorithms. Here are some of the lessons from recent history?s big crashes.', 'Flash crash, October 2016', 'If a crash is unrelated to the economic fundamentals, it will quickly be corrected. This was the case of the flash crash inOctober 2016when the pound plunged by 6% against the dollar in a mere two minutes of trading.', 'This phenomenon can occur because of large sell orders from computer program trading, which may lead to sudden drops in liquidity. A lack of buyers to match the large sell orders pushes the price down, making the market illiquid.', 'In this type of crash, the market mistakenly believes that the sell orders are driven by new information on fundamentals, while it may be due to a wrong algorithm in a computer program. Once the market understands that the sell orders did not originate from genuinely bad news, stock prices should rebound.', 'Black Monday, October 1987', 'The biggest and most famous stockmarket crashis known as Black Monday, and took place on October 19, 1987. Stockmarketsaround the world were hit, with theDowplummeting 22.6% ? still its largest one-day percentage decline.', 'TheBlack Mondaycrash has been attributed in part to a large number of ?stop loss orders? ? orders that are in place to sell a security once it falls below a certain limit (to stop your losses). Computer programs, being used for large-scale trading, were relatively new to Wall Street at the time and they began to liquidate stocks as soon as loss targets were hit.', 'A domino effect took place ? when many investors submit stop loss orders simultaneously, this drags the price of stocks down, resulting in a crash.', 'This alonedoes not explain the extent of the crash. New regulatory restrictions may also have caused a lack of liquidity in the market, pushing down the price of stocks.', 'Unlike with the 2016 flash crash, the market did not rebound immediately after theBlack Mondaycrash. This suggests that it also reflected the fundamentals at play. Similar to the recent crash, theBlack Mondaycrash was accompanied by expectations of interest rate hikes.', 'Bursting bubbles', 'If stocks keep rising in price, but their fundamental values do not also rise, then they are overvalued and a bubble forms. This could be a result of speculation or technical traders who focus more on the price history of the stock and what the market is doing.', 'The key here is that while many market participants may agree that stocks are overvalued, they may think that others are unaware of this and they can capitalise on it. But sooner or later there will be a correction, when stock prices fall in line with their fundamental value.', 'This bursting is often preceded by a sharp increase in prices. The sudden drop occurs when the market suddenly realises that they have been mispriced, thanks to some new piece of information ? the straw that breaks the camel?s back.', 'There is also the effect ofherd behaviourat play. Just as traders can buy stocks because everyone else is, traders can also follow the herd and sell, if they see everybody else doing so. This leads to a race to the bottom.', 'This happened with thedot-com bubble in the late 1990s, which involved stocks of high-tech companies. Optimistic individual investors are thought to have created the bubble, based on unrealistic expectations on the future performance of dot-com stocks. But the bubble burst once large institutional investors started selling off their dot-com stocks, making individual investors quickly change their mind and leading to large sell-offs.', 'When bubbles burst, stock prices will not rise to the previous level until the fundamentals improve again.

Cars, for instance, are designed to protect their occupants from crashes with other cars, buildings, guardrails, telephone poles and other objects commonly found in or near roads. They?re not designed to keep people safe in cars driven off a cliff or smashed by huge rocks dropped on them. It?s just not cost-effective to engineer defenses against those threats, because they?re assumed to be extremely uncommon.', 'Similarly, people designing software and hardware make assumptions about what hackers might do. But that doesn?t mean devices are safe. One of the first side-channel attacks was identified back in 1996 by cryptographer Paul Kocher, who showed he could break popular and supposedly secure cryptosystems bycarefully timing how long it tooka computer to decrypt an encrypted message. The cryptosystem designers hadn?t imagined that an attacker would take that approach, so their system was vulnerable to it.', 'There have been many other attacks through the years using all sorts of different approaches.

And by combining readings from two or more devices, it?s often possible to do things that users, phone designers and app creators alike may not expect.', 'Inone recent project, we developed an app that could determine what letters a user was typing on a mobile phone?s on-screen keyboard ? without reading inputs from the keyboard. Rather, we combined information from the phone?s gyroscope and its microphones.', 'When a user taps on the screen in different locations, the phone itself rotates slightly in ways that can be measured by thethree-axis micromechanical gyroscopesfound in most current phones.', 'Further, tapping on a phone screen produces a sound that can be recorded on each of a phone?s multiple microphones. A tap close to the center of the screen will not move the phone much, will reach both microphones at the same time, and will sound roughly the same to all the microphones. However, a tap at the bottom left edge of the screen will rotate the phone left and down; it will reach the left microphone faster; and it will sound louder to microphones near the bottom of the screen and quieter to microphones elsewhere on the device.', 'Processing the movement and sound data together let us determine what key a user pressed, and we were right over 90 percent of the time. This sort of function could be added secretly to any app and could run unnoticed by a user.', 'Identifying a location', 'We then wondered whether a malicious application could infer a user?s whereabouts, including where they lived and worked, and what routes they traveled ? information most people consider very private.', 'We wanted to find out whether a user?s location could be identified using only sensors that don?t require users? permission. The route taken by a driver, for instance, can be simplified into a series of turns, each in a certain direction and with a certain angle. With another app, we used a phone?s compass to observe the person?s direction of travel. That app also used the phone?s gyroscope, measuring the sequence of turn angles of the route traveled by the user. And the accelerometer showed whether a user was stopped, or moving.', 'By measuring a sequence of turns, and stringing them together as a person travels, we could make a map of their movements. (In our work, we knew which city we were tracking people through, but a similar approach could be used to figure out what city a person was in.)', 'Imagine we observe aperson in Boston heading southwest, turning 100 degrees to the right, making a sharp U-turn to the left to head southeast, turning slightly to the right, continuing straight, then following a shallow curve to the left, a quick jog to the right, bumping up and down more than usual on a road, turning 55 degrees right, and turning 97 degrees left and then making a slight curve right before stopping.', 'We developed an algorithm to match those movements up against a digitized map of the streets of the city the user was in, and determined which were the most likely routes a person might take. Those movements could identify a route driving from Fenway Park, along the Back Bay Fens, past the Museum of Fine Arts and arriving at Northeastern University.', 'We were even able to refine our algorithm to incorporate information about curves in roads and speed limits to help narrow options. We produced our results as alist of possible pathsranked by how likely the algorithm thought they were to match the actual route. About half the time, in most cities we tried, the real path a user followed was in the top 10 items on the list. Further refining the map data, sensor readings and the matching algorithm could substantially improve our accuracy. Again, this type of capability could be added to any app by a malicious developer, letting innocent-appearingappssnoop on their users.', 'Our research group is continuing to investigate how side-channel attacks can be used to reveal a variety of private information. For instance, measuring how a phone moves when its owner is walking could suggest how old a person is, whether they are male (with the phone in a pocket) or female (typically with the phone in a purse), or even health information about how steady a person is on his feet or how often she stumbles.

An analysis of the times and distances in Under - 18 track and field events held in the US and UK byBusiness Standardshows that India's junior athletes still have a long way to go before they can catch up with American and British athletes. The records of these junior international athletes were then compared with the records achieved by India's junior athletes in theKhelo Indiaschool games. A look at the timings achieved in track events shows that India?s school athletes have grossly underperformed as compared to their American and British counterparts. While the Indians have under-performed, British kids have given a tough competition in some of the events to the Americans. But on the whole, American kids much like their senior counterparts who clock the highest medals tally in virtually every Olympics, run faster, jump higher and throw farther than anyone else.In the 400 meters run, Gandi Dhanush Kumar who hails from Andhra Pradesh clocked a timing of 49.05 seconds in the recently concluded school games organised by the Modi government under its flagshipKhelo India scheme.In comparison, 17-year-old American athlete Tyrese Cooper clocked an impressive 45.38 seconds at the Under-18 games held at Ypsilanti in Michigan. British junior games athlete Ethan Brown meanwhile ran 400 meters in 47.82 seconds. Kumar took 3.67 seconds more than his American competitor to complete the race despite coming out on top ? a massive difference in an event where victory and defeat are often defined in milliseconds.Indian school athletes meanwhile are no better when it comes to more intense races where the line between the winner and the loser is even thinner. In the 200-meter sprint, Indian school athlete V A Shashikumar, clocked 21.82 seconds. Meanwhile, American 200-meter champion Tyrese Cooper finished the race in 20.51 seconds to come out on top at the Under-18 games held at Eugene in Oregon. This difference of 1.31 seconds between the Indian and the American junior athlete is much larger when compared to the British.(See table)While India?s school athletes need to train harder to match their European and American competitors, there are some reasons to be optimistic about the future of India?s track athletes. In the 100-meter sprint, junior athlete Nisar Ahmed clocked an impressive timing of 10.76 seconds. Junior American athlete Anthony Schwartz had clocked 10.15 seconds at Gaineville in Florida last year. But Ahmed?s performance in the past has impressed many. Ahmed, the son of a rickshaw puller in Delhi, will be training at Usain Bolt?s Racers?Track Club in Jamaica this year. With the guidance of the world?s fastest man and world class facilities at his club, Nisar certainly looks like a bright prospect in India?s quest forOlympicsglory in track events. The sole shining light at theKhelo Indiaschool games was Punga Soren from Odisha. His timing of 14.12 seconds was much better than his American and British counterparts. Soren outpaced them by over 30 milliseconds.The head coach ofNationalInstitute of Sports, Patiala, Bahudur Singh toldBusiness Standard, ?72 per cent of the India's youth live in villages and there is an immediate need of playground in the villages. The government owned land is available in every village, if boys and girls are allowed to play in these ground then we do not need that much of fund in the initial stage and the future of the young athletes will be sealed.?Meanwhile, Indian girls? performance was even more unimpressive. In the 800-metre race, Tai Bamhane who comes from Maharashtra had clocked a timing of 2:13.37 minutes in theKhelo IndiaSchool Games. In comparison, Anna Burt of Britain clocked a timing of 2:04.50 minutes in U-18 games in Manchester. A similar under-performance is discernable in 100-metre sprint as well. Avantika Narale of Pune clocked a timing of 12.36 seconds atKhelo India School gamesin New Delhi."", ""While, the 17-year old American athlete Sha'Carri Richardson was a good 1:08 seconds faster than Narale while sprinting in Austin at Texas last year. With her performance, Narale wouldn?t have been even able to qualify for the American junior 100-meter sprint. The performance of school athletes in field events like Pole vault, long jump and high jump also show dismal performances vis-a- vis international standard.(See table)""]",/article/current-affairs/khelo-india-india-s-junior-athletes-fail-to-outrun-american-british-kids-118020801020_1.html

Ramesh claimed the scheme would anyway benefit private hospitals rather than the public.It is being touted as \'ModiCare\', he said. Taking a jibe, he said by this logic AIIMS may be called an institute of ""Modical"" sciences.Ramesh said that an insurance scheme existed during the UPA tenure and only the money had been increased. It was a work in continuation, he claimed.A former Union minister, Ramesh, said that a health assurance approach would have been better than an insurance scheme as past experience has demonstrated.He said the budgetary allocation required for the scheme was somewhere between Rs 120 billion to Rs 1 trillion but a grossly insufficient Rs 20 billion had been allocated.He termed the scheme as ""NAMO, or no allocation, messaging only"".On the jobs front, Ramesh said the government was focussing on the EPFO figures to estimate jobs created, which he claimed was a wrong approach.He said the raise in provident fund accounts had happened as there was formalisation of the informal sector due toGSTand demonetisation. Even as this was a beneficial result of these two measures, he said exaggerated claims related to job creation were being made based on EPFO data, he said.""To say all these jobs are new, would be completely wrong,"" Ramesh said seeking to punch holes in the government\'s claims on employment. He said recent comments by the chief economic advisor had also indicated the same.Referring to BJP member Subramanian Swamy, he said the senior leader had recently stated there was pressure on the central statistical organisation to present data in such a way that it appears there was no unfavourable impact ofGSTand demonetisation.He also questioned the government\'s claims on ease of doing business and said the rise in India\'s rankings was only courtesy a change criterion used for measuring the performance of various countries. The government was, however, presenting it as some sort of miracle, he said.He said that thought India had moved upwards, it was only due to the new insolvency law that was brought in. These measures, however, encourage a hire and fire policy towards employees, he said.Ramesh accused the government of making exaggerated claims on issues like job creation. Following Ramesh\'s speech, BJP member Mahesh Poddar and SP leader Neeraj Shekhar also spoke. The discussion will continue tomorrow.Earlier, afterRajeev Chandrashekhar(Independent) had spoken, the Chair called Ramesh to move the debate on the Budget further.Ramesh said the Budget was ""unusual and historic"" because soon after its presentation, the Prime Minister came on deferred live telecast to decode the Budget.Normally, he said that after Budget, the prime minister congratulate his finance minister for its presentation.Before he could continue, members from the treasury benches objected to the comments.', 'This lead to heated arguments between BJP and Congress. Some other opposition members too supported the Congress.The Chair tried to pacify the two sides, but in vain. The House was adjourned for 10 minutes.When the House reassembled, Ramesh continued his speech.In the meanwhile, C M Ramesh of TDP and three of his party colleagues entered the Well carrying placards.They were also shouting slogans.The Chair asked them to return to seats but in vain. Deputy Chairman Bhubaneswar Kalita asked Ramesh to continue his speech even as TDP members were raising slogans.Ramesh said he could not speak amid the din and got support from other opposition members also. Minister of State for Parliamentary Affairs Vijay Goel urged the protesting members to return to seats.However, they did not yield. The Chair adjourned the House for another 10 minutes. When the House met again, there was ruckus and another adjournment followed.When the House met again, the protesting TDP members again came to the Well. Opposition members asked the Chair to bring the House in order. But as the stalemate continued, the Chair adjourned the Rajya Sabha for 30 minutes for dinner. It was at the next assembling of the House that Ramesh managed to complete his speech.']",/article/current-affairs/namo-or-no-allocation-messaging-only-will-fail-modicare-jairam-ramesh-118020900003_1.html

The government led by President Gayoon (who was in his third consecutive term) hid in a safe house and managed to send a request for help to the Indian government through the Indian High Commission in Male. The Indian government decided to intervene quickly and decisively. The crack team of the Para Brigade led by Brigadier Farooq Bulsara was asked to carry out the operation and rescue the Maldivian President. This operation was namedOperation Cactus.In his book Mission Overseas, journalist Sushant Singh has given details of the operation. He has revealed the difficulties that were encountered, mostly due to lack of information. The book reveals the political thought that went behind the launch of this operation, its execution and how the world saw the operation.Here are some excerpts from the chapter onOperation Cactusfrom the book,Mission Overseas:Maintaining India's zone of influenceRajiv Gandhi had made it clear to his team of officials that the neighbourhood was India?s zone of influence. While India as the largest country in the region had to bear the fallout of conflicts and unrest within its smaller neighbouring countries, it had to also not hesitate to play its rightful role in the region. Against that backdrop, Indian officials were able to swiftly put together the future course of action.Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi eventually took a firm decision at 3.30 that afternoon for it. But G. Parthasarthy remembers bypassing the defence secretary, T. N. Seshan - who later became famous as this hardnosed chief election commissioner ? and requisitioning an aircraft for the journalists directly from the Indian Air Force (IAF). As Partha got busy managing the complex media arrangements, the prime minister had a special instruction for him. ?Time is doing a major piece on India?s rise as a regional power. Please make sure that Ross Amroe, the Time journalist who met me for the story, is on board,? Rajiv told him.After the operationAt about 3.15 a.m., Bulsara and Banerjee entered the NSS headquarters immediately after M. K. Singh had escorted the President (Gayoom) into the building. A score of dead bodies, mostly of rebels and mercenaries, lay around the building. The pockmarked walls bore ample proof of the mercenaries? dogged efforts to break in and of the NSS men?s equally determined efforts not to let them in.Banerjee remembers that the President ?looked shaken but was in full command, and was happy to receive us."", 'He had with him his foreign minister and one or two others. He thanked us for the timely help and said he wanted to speak to the PM, Rajiv Gandhi.? The satellite telephone link between Delhi and Malé was still functional and at 4 a.m. President Gayoom spoke to Rajiv Gandhi from the NSS headquarters. He thanked Rajiv for the timely assistance, telling him that the Indian soldiers were in full control of Malé. Ronen Sen recalls that Rajiv was at that time working on his desktop computer ? ?typing with one finger as he always did? ? and it was only after this call with President Gayoom that he went to sleep.']",/article/international/when-india-launched-operation-cactus-to-suppress-a-coup-in-maldives-118020900228_1.html

Rahman and four others have been sentenced to 10 years in prison.Judge Mohammad Akhtaruzzaman, who delivering the judgement, said: ""The case was proved beyond any doubt against the accused"".The case is one of dozens pending against Zia, who has been a rival of Prime MinisterSheikh Hasinafor decades.', 'The charges against her had already led to her boycotting polls in 2014, which triggered widespread protests at the time.Zia, wearing a white sari, appeared in person in the heavily-guarded courtroom amid heightened political tension.Sentencing Zia to rigorous imprisonment, the judge read out the abridged version of the 632-page verdict in 10 minutes.He said that though all the convicts played identical role in the crime but Zia was given a lesser term taking into account her ""age and social status"".The court also said that the defence tried their best to hinder the trial proceedings as they sought time for 35 occasions in the name of changing the court.The other convicts are former lawmaker Kazi Salimul Haque Kamal, businessman Sharfuddin Ahmed, ex-premier\'s principal secretary Kamal Uddin Siddiqui and her nephew Mominur Rahman.Zia became the second head of the government after former military dictator-turned-politician HM Ershad to be convicted in a graft case.Legal experts said the verdict may jeopardise her career as she may be disqualified from contesting polls, including the general elections slated for December.The ruling came four years after Zia and others were indicted in the case.""We will challenge the verdict in the High Court... God willing we will get justice there,"" Zia\'s chief counsel Khondker Mahbub Hossain told reporters.Immediately after the verdict was read out, security personnel escorted Zia to a white vehicle which took her to old Dhaka\'s Central Jail.The original jail was relocated recently to suburban Keraniganj but officials said they renovated the day care centre of the facility to accommodate the ex-premier.Home Minister Asaduzzaman Khan said: ""She served as the premier thrice and is the chairperson of a big political party... considering her age and status she will be provided all facilities she deserved"".TV footages showed Zia stood in gloom covering her eyes in a dark sunglass as the security forces escorted the vehicle to the nearby jail.There was tight security in Dhaka streets as the ex-prime minister was on her way to a court with a convoy of armed police and Zia\'s private security personnel\'s vehicles slowly escorting her to the court in downtown Dhaka from her Gulshan residence.Elite anti-crime Rapid Action Battalion and armed police kept a sharp vigil, blocking temporarily the thoroughfares she used for ordinary vehicles.Witnesses said hundreds of Zia\'s supporters thronged the streets leading to the court complex and followed the convoy, causing clashes with the police at places.Police had to use tear gas shells and fired rubber bullets as the BNP activists exploded crackers and pelted stones at Kakrail area soon after the convoy passed the spot.Earlier at a press conference yesterday, Zia blamed the ruling party (the Bangladesh Awami League led by Prime Minister Hasina) for unleashing a ""reign of terror"" and claimed that she was implicated in a ""false case"".Meanwhile, Awami League general secretary and Road Transport Minister Obaidul Quader said that the past military- backed interim government filed the case against Zia in 2008 with the incumbent government having no links to the process.Political analysts said the BNP might be split as several senior leaders could disassociate them from Zia as her son Rahman, the senior vice president of the party, was wielding authority from London, ignoring the party veterans.Rahman is believed to have sought asylum in the UK to evade justice, as he is also being tried on several charges including the August 21, 2004 grenade attack on a rally of the then opposition Awami League when 23 people were killed and prime minister Hasina narrowly escaped the attack.The ex-premier on November 30, 2014 lost her last ditch effort to evade the graft trial as the Supreme Court turned down her second \'leave to appeal\' petition challenging her indictment and asked her to face trial in the lower court.The High Court earlier validated the trial in the lower court which on March 19, 2014 indicted Zia on two graft charges brought by the Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC).Zia and three of her aides in particular were accused of syphoning off 31.5 million taka (about USD 400,000) from the Zia Charitable Trust alone. She is also accused of leading a group of five people, including her eldest son, in embezzling another 21.5 million taka (USD 277,000) funds.']",/article/international/ex-bangladesh-pm-khaleda-zia-gets-5-yrs-in-jail-in-250-000-corruption-case-118020801196_1.html

A commendable feat no doubt, and a reason to work even harder to achieve the 60 GW target from windenergyby 2022.', 'Achieving that target and creating a feasible and economically viable windenergymarket inIndiawill require the government and wind industry participants to be cognizant of trends and changes. The switch to an auction-based allocation of wind capacity from a feed-in tariff system has been done by the policymakers to encourage more competition and better price discovery.', 'While the advantages of an auction-based system of competitive bidding and better price discovery are obvious, one needs to keep an eye on the potential problems that might crop up. Excessive competition can at times lead to unviable auction pricing with serious ramifications for the industry. The trade-off between lower costs and delivering the targeted windenergycapacity needs urgent attention.', 'First and foremost, one needs to assess whether bidding forrenewableenergyprojects can in certain instances lead to aggressive bidding by developers. While low prices are good for the eventual customer, it is important to find a right balance between low pricing and financially viable projects.', 'Projects that score high on low pricing but turn out to be financially unviable endanger the entire ecosystem with reduced windenergygeneration, potentially distressed loans, and contracts that are not honoured. A strictly enforced penalty mechanism can potentially be used to ensure to some extent that unviable bidding is avoided as penalties would encourage developers of windenergyprojects to bid at financially viable levels.', 'In addition, it would also be prudent to look at the primary asset, i.e., the wind generation capacity of the site, and work towards a bifurcated market. High-quality wind sites can potentially use auctions while feed-in tariffs might work better for wind sites of lower quality. Such a bifurcation will allow the market to gradually evolve towards an auction mechanism and yet provideIndiawith an opportunity to realise its wind generation capacity.', 'In addition, this will assist overall windenergymarket development as pricing will be done based on the intrinsic value of the asset.', 'One would, of course, expect developers to price in the intrinsic asset value in their bids, but at times aggressive price wars can lead to pricing that is not viable. This is where the government may need to step in to ensure that pricing matches asset quality. As mentioned earlier, a bifurcated market would go a long way towards sustainable pricing in the windenergymarket.', 'To understand the issue of windenergyauction mechanism better, it is important to learn a few lessons from other countries. In the paper ""RenewableEnergyAuctions and Tenders: How Good are They?"",David Tokelooks at Danish and South Africanrenewableenergyprojects and concludes that a significant proportion of the cost reduction is due to technological improvements and not from the auction mechanism itself.', 'Feed-in tariffs set at the optimal level, above the marginal cost of therenewableenergydeveloper, can potentially deliver the cost savings and yet ensure that project viability is maintained.', 'While the conclusions from the study may not be fully applicable to India, it is worth looking at. Auctions, for all their advantages, need to be looked at with an eye to creating a sustainable windenergyecosystem.', 'A portion of the opportunity in windenergyinIndiais around repowering of existing wind farms with more efficient wind turbines. It is important to view this as a golden opportunity forIndiato becomeenergyindependent. Hence the additionalenergygenerated through such turbine repowering would merit a case-by-case analysis in terms of whether to use an auction mechanism or feed-in tariff to encourage such business.', 'In summary, it is important for policymakers to keep an eye on how much new generation capacity in wind is seen in the years to come.Indiawill have to maintain a balance between lowering costs and ensuring high deployment ofrenewableenergy.Both feed-in tariffs or auctions, if used prudently, can aid in the growth of the windenergysector.

It has been nominated in six categories, including Best Picture and Best Actor for Gary Oldman who plays Britain?s wartime prime ministerWinston Churchill.At the BAFTAs, scheduled later this month, the film is nominated in nine categories, including Best Picture, Best Actor in a Leading Role, and Best Actress in a Leading Role (Kristin Scott Thomas), and is quite likely to sweep it. Oldman?s performance has already been felicitated with a Golden Globe.The reviews, too, have been superlative about Oldman?s craft and the film.The Atlanticgushed: ?John Wright (the director)... is happy to celebrate the theatricality of the man, the thundering bulldog who became emblematic of the British blitz spirit, and an international symbol of resistance to Nazi rule.? The reviewer, David Sims, adds, ?It?s a performance practically designed... to win an Academy Award (and I?m sure it will).? Anthony Lane inThe New Yorkerquestions the necessity for another Churchill film, but that?s it. Writing forThe New York Times, A O Scott questions whether the self-congratulatory spirit of Britain in the film is worth applauding in these Brexit times, but adds a laudatory appraisal of the former British PM: ?Churchill himself is among the most revered and studied figures of 20th-century history: a synonym for leadership; a great man in an age of monsters?For me, however, Churchill, who served as a second lieutenant of the Fourth Hussars in 1896 in India and described the jewel in the crown as a ?Godless land of snobs and bores?, has no special appeal. In 1943, he starved three million people in my native Bengal. But, the Churchill industry has managed to create a political behemoth and protector of democracy, and conceal his war crimes. Take for instance another piece by Lane (?Why Actors Love to Play Churchill?) in The New Yorker, where he gives a list of famous actors to play the role: Albert Finney, Richard Burton, Michael Gambon, Robert Hardy, Brendan Gleeson, Brian Cox, John Lithgow, Timothy Spall and Viktor Stanitsyn (four times). Lane describes the enterprise as the ?noble sport of Churchill-playing?.There is nothing noble about it though. In Darkest Hour, the first time we see Churchill, he is having breakfast: eggs, bacon, champagne, scotch ? all on a silver tray, with shining cutlery. Repeated references are made throughout the film of his chronic drinking and there are more scenes where he polishes off large meals.The New York Timesdescribes this as a portrayal of a man with a large appetite, the man hungry enough to get the job done. For him, this war is a sort of sport indeed, and even the Germans knocking on the door can hardly dent his legendary wit. Yet those bankrolling Churchill?s war against the Nazis and Fascists were starving Indians.The facts of the famine in 1943 are not unknown; Satyajit Ray made a film (Ashani Sanket)on it in 1973.', 'However, in recent times, the matter was hotly debated following the publication of Madhusree Mukherjee?s Churchill?s Secret War (2010). Historian Mukherjee places the engineered calamity within the context of British imperialism and the attitudes of Churchill and his Cabinet with regards to Mahatma Gandhi?s Quit India movement. The marvellous book establishes beyond doubt how Churchill and his associates could have easily prevented the famine, but refused to do so, despite repeated appeals of the Indian government and even the US president.']",/article/beyond-business/darkest-hour-why-another-churchill-film-118020900385_1.html

While regulations and strict KYC/AML regulations still enablebanksto continue to be in business, the power they once wielded is diminishing. As Niti Aayog Chairman, Amitabh Kant said ?Debit cards, credit cards and ATMs might lose relevance in the next four years?.Even Government has joined the fray and with an intent to ensure banking & financial services are accessible to all is pushing ahead with reforms. Powered by the Government?s push for digital India and cashless transactions, several opportunities have been created forfintechcompanies. The Government has also rolled out requisite infrastructure, the so called India stack comprising Aadhar as biometric ID, e-KYC, digital signature and a low cost NPCI/UPI transaction system. It has helped reduce friction for consumers, made it more convenient, less costly and has opened doors for greater services outside traditional banking channels.We expectfintechcompanies playing a significant role in shaking the earning foundation of big banks, as they are significantly reducing costs for consumers. In the coming decade, there could also be afintechcompany with a large enough market cap, as compared tobanks.As mentioned earlier, out of three buckets of products, delivery and customers,Fintechcompanies are already acquiring direct customers and are becoming delivery partners ofbanks.The core banking products will still be withbanksdue to prudential norms and regulations but in a competitive market, with hardly any product differentiation, owning customers and the sales channel becomes the key. Add to this the fact that having access to customers and customer data also enables providing add on services. We have seen this with marketplace models like bankbazaar.com, policybazaar.com who have reduced information arbitrage, lowered costs and provided greater choices for consumers.Whilefintechcompanies bring in greater efficiency, transparency and have a stabilising effect on the entire financial system, this may also cause the demise of a few leadingbanksas we know it.', 'With the influx offintechcompanies in the system, there are high likelihoods of bank?s core operations such as lending and accepting deposits will undergo changes. Other high income generating activities like forex, wealth management and treasury operations will definitely be affected in many ways.On the downside though, fintech companies are hobbled by extensive KYC/AML guidelines, digital identity authentication as well as lack of infrastructure compared tobanks.Fintech companies also suffer from ambiguous regulations and still evolving nature of regulations and rules India. The most recent example was P2P lending which was flourishing in the regulatory vacuum till RBI came up with new rules [The Reserve Bank of India (RBI), on October 4, classified peer-to-peer (P2P) lending as an NBFC activity. While this is a step forward in the right regulatory direction, several aspects still need to be cleared up. Another example is cryptocurrency exchanges, where the government or the regulators seem unable to make up their minds.Despite the challenges, wherefintechcompanies excel, is in their customer engagement and experience along with data analytics and delivering services through newer paradigms. Some of these areas are which were peripheral tobankscore operations like payments, have become saturated with companies already in the process of re-inventing their models.However, not all is lost for the traditional banks, who are in fact the biggest partners and sometimes the backers of thefintechindustry. They are taking the easy way out and instead of building capabilities within, are either investing or acquiring specialized companies to gain specific capabilities. IDFC recently partnering Capital Float a non-traditional lender to SMEs focusing on quick delivery, and catering to a wide variety of borrowers is a case in point. Similarly Axis Bank acquiring Freecharge, to get access to its customer base and technology platform. We see this sector to continue to attract funding and investor interest in 2018 and beyond.']",/article/finance/fintech-will-change-how-we-bank-118020900715_1.html

When the book came out in 2004, the US-led war against theTalibanand Al Qaeda seemed on the wane, at least compared to the then-raging insurgency in Iraq. Soon, however, with the aid of their longtime sponsors in Pakistan?s Inter-Services Intelligence agency, theTalibanwould reconstitute their movement and seize control over great swathes of the Afghan countryside, dueling the US and the Afghan Army to a stalemate. If current trends hold, the US will in the not-too-distant future be sending soldiers to the ?graveyard of empires? that hadn?t even been born on 9/11.QuickTake Afghanistan\'s WarColl?s new book, ?Directorate S: The C. I. A. and America?s Secret Wars inAfghanistanand Pakistan,? tells the story of this new war in equally magisterial fashion. The narrative is punctuated by folly, frustration and hubris, with the U. S. striving unsuccessfully to convince the Pakistanis to abandon support for their Islamist proxies -- tools, generals in Rawalpindi believe, to counter Indian influence inAfghanistan-- and to defeat theTalibanon the battlefield. It comes out just as a series of horrific attacks in Kabul have reminded the world how ineradicable theAfghan insurgencyremains. I spoke with Coll about where he thinks America?s longest war is headed and how it might, finally, end. The following is an edited and condensed version of our conversation:NISID HAJARI: Now that theTrump Administrationhas released its ?new strategy? for Afghanistan, including an increase in the number of airstrikes, you?re starting to hear US commanders talk again about gaining momentum and reaching a ?turning point? in the war. After retracing the first 15 years of this conflict, what do you think when you hear such comments?STEVE COLL: Well, the history is dispiriting when you excavate it because it\'s so repetitive. And some of the reason is what you suggest, that new commander come in, they don\'t stay for longer than two years in high military command, sometimes shorter. Not to be too cynical about it, but their career depends on a narrative of achievement. I remember Eliot Cohen, who was a counselor to [then-Secretary of State] Condoleezza Rice during the Bush Administration, recounting how he discovered that the six-month command rotations had a common pattern: A new commander would come in and say, ?This looks like it\'s going to be very, very difficult.? And then, six months later, he?d say, ?We\'ve irreversibly changed the momentum of the war.? As a writer, it was a narrative challenge, because at a certain point I would think, ""Haven\'t I already told this story?""NH: Do you see anything materially different in the Trump administration?s strategy compared to those that have been tried in the past?SC: Well, yes and no. Yes, the administration has been more explicit about challenging Pakistan, and the decision to withhold [military] aid conditionally is a significant departure. Unfortunately, I don?t see the case that it\'s going to be decisive in changing Pakistani conduct because the amount of aid, while significant as a top-line dollar figure, is not significant from the perspective of Pakistan\'s political economy, especially because they have this deep, deep relationship withChina.Also, the problem is not just that American influence has diminished but that theTrump Administrationhas taken up the same line, in only a slightly varied form, of the Bush and the Obama administrations, which is, ?Yes, we understand that there is no military solution to this war.? And yet what they resource, what they prioritize is military action without any predominant or even parallel political strategy. Trying really to get the Chinese to put pressure on Pakistan, having a clear idea of what you\'re asking Pakistan to change about its conduct -- I don\'t see any of that happening.NH: I was in Lahore recently, and among middle- and upper-class Pakistanis, there seem to be two narratives: One is that Pakistan no longer needs the U. S. because of China, and the other is that, in fact, Pakistan is quite vulnerable economically and may need to return soon to theInternationalMonetary Fund, and that Chinese support isn?t unconditional. Which narrative do you favor?SC: I think the assessment that Pakistan is vulnerable to IMF pressure and thatChinais ambivalent about Pakistan\'s dysfunction and accommodation of militants is correct. That, at least theoretically, is an opportunity, although when really pressed to choose sides, the Chinese have been reluctant to do so -- not necessarily because they think that Pakistan should be defended against all critics, but because the US-Chinese relationship has so many other priorities and friction points.Pakistan, I think, would actually prefer to have a balanced relationship withChinaand the United States. In the currentinternationalenvironment, where there is a lot of uncertainty about America?s role in the world, I think making a bet onChinaseems likely to be an easier decision [laughs] than it did 10 or 15 years ago. But, if you\'re a small country like Pakistan is, and you\'ve got great powers in your orbit, the natural strategy is to have access to both, to keep both in balance and try to use that equilibrium as a space to grow.NH: What would it take to enlist Chinese help in changing Pakistani behavior?SC: During the Obama administration, I participated in these Track 1.5 meetings with Chinese specialists onAfghanistanand Pakistan. You\'d meet with these people that had been engaged in the region for a long time and try to have these conversations about exactly the question you asked. And I took away a couple of observations. One was that the specialists inChinawho thought about Pakistan andAfghanistanjust weren\'t influential enough to be heard over issues like SouthChinaSea, future of North Korea, future of US-Chinatrade, great power balancing. We were on the C-list in U. S.-Chinarelations.And then secondly, when you did get around to Pakistan, they did have an interest in suppressing transnational Islamist movements that could inflame populations in westernChina.Definitely concerned about that. Definitely not opposed to US counterterrorism efforts against transnational militant groups. But, their main interest was Pakistani stability and prosperity. And I remember one meeting where one of our Chinese counterparts said, ?We used to track your strategy because we couldn\'t figure out how to improve Pakistan. We noted that you switched from a centralized approach to a more of a province-by-province approach. Then we decided to switch from a centralized approach to a more province-by-province approach. And at the end of a couple of years we concluded that neither you nor we were succeeding.?

One was Vladimir Putin, the other congressionalRepublicans.Both behaved as if there was no such thing as a win-win situation: Any gain for Obama was a loss for them, and any gain for them must also entail a loss for Obama. The moment that theRussian presidentor congressionalRepublicanssaw he wanted something, they went to work trying to keep him from getting it -- even if it was something they might otherwise have approved of.Approaching any aspect of life as a zero-sum game has obvious practical costs: Deals that leave some people better off without making anyone else worse off suddenly don?t get done, because making some people better off now, by definition, makes other people worse off. It also comes with some psychological side effects. It cripples your imagination. It blinds and deafens you, as you sort of know what your adversary is going to do or say before they do or say it. Or, rather, you know how you are going to make sense of it: uncharitably.The zero-sum approach inpoliticshas since spread, as it tends to do wherever it takes hold. It has infected congressionalDemocratsand parts of the news media, and is seeping into the everyday political discourse. Take the case of Stormy Daniels, the porn star, whose interview with In Touch Weekly, along with a bunch of related stories, rests in a tall pile on my lap, as I ride the train from New York to Washington. She claims that in 2006 Donald Trump, whose wife had just given birth to their son, launched a sexual affair with her. She was, according to the Wall Street Journal, paid 130 grand by a Trump lawyer just before the election to keep quiet. Trump?sWhite Houseobviously thinks it?s smart to humiliate reporters for even trivial errors, if they happen to reflect poorly on Trump. If Daniels was just making it all up, and the media had repeated her lies, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the press secretary, would be shouting from the lectern and Trump would be ranting about fake news. Instead, they?ve been silent.And so I think most people, in their heart of hearts, would agree that Daniels is probably telling the truth. In her In Touch interview, she recounts a couple of evenings she spent with Trump, in revealing detail. She describes walking into his suite at the Beverly Hills Hotel, for instance. ?You could see the television from the little dining room table and he was watching Shark Week,? she recalled. ?And he was watching a special about the U. S. S. something and it sank and it was like the worst shark attack in history. He is obsessed with sharks. Terrified of sharks. He was like, ?I donate to all these charities and I would never donate to a charity that helps sharks. I hope all the sharks die.? He was like riveted. He was like obsessed. It was so strange, I know.?Daniels had a lot of interesting things to say about our president, not all of them damning. But the world hardly paused to appreciate her words. Trump?s allies shut their eyes and ears to them, as to pay attention would benefit their adversaries. Fox News barely mentioned the story. Trump?s enemies focused on the words that might be weaponized (affair with a porn star, 130 grand payout) and sort of ignored the others. When the attacks failed to lower the esteem in which mostRepublicanshold Trump -- and really, how surprised can even the most dewy-eyed Trump supporter be that he did any of this stuff? -- the story faded. The parts of the story that reveal new aspects of Trump?s character are already receding from view. For instance:1. He?s not a complete lout. He asked her questions about herself. He took an interest in her career. He asked her to sign a DVD. It wasn?t exactly textbook chivalry, but he was far less harsh and transactional than the people who despise him would imagine. Daniels seems to have sort of liked him.2. The sharks. I can think of many responses one might have to shark attacks. I?ll never give money to shark charities isn?t one of them. It?s even odder because Trump is so famously tightfisted: This is a man who allegedly used the money in his charitable fund to buy a grandiose portrait of himself. Does his mind turn to giving only when he is thinking of the people and causes to whom he will not give?And what?s this fear in him? In public, Trump preys on the fears of others, while acknowledging no fear of his own. But alone in his hotel room, he wants nothing more than to experience fear, on an endless loop. At least untilStormy Danielsarrives.I hand my driver?s license to the armed guards at theWhite Housegates and say, ?White Housepress? and half expect them to laugh. I?ve never actually felt like a proper journalist and am always surprised when I?m allowed to masquerade as one. Yet Bloomberg has handed me not only a badge to wear around my neck and a privileged seat in the second row of the press room but also, it will emerge, a serious question to ask Sarah Huckabee Sanders. The question is: ?Do you agree with Secretary Mnuchin?s desire for a weak dollar??Just this morning, at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin apparently said he thought a weak dollar was a good idea. The dollar is falling.TheWhite Housepress briefing room sounds like an exciting place to visit, but the minute you are in it you sort of wish you weren?t. It has the cramped uncared-for feel of a public toilet, or a cable television green room. The unenthusiastic attempts to decorate the place were made long ago: a pair of photographs signed by Ronald Reagan, a framed collection of the pens used by Lyndon Johnson to sign Great Society legislation. Obama used to pop in here from time to time, but Trump never does. He prefers the journalists brought to him, often at a moment?s notice. I can?t say I blame him.Just to see what it feels like I walk up and stand behind the lectern -- then see a small sign that says it?s against the rules.I take my seat half an hour early and silently practice asking my question several different ways. None of them sound like the questions you hear when you watch the press briefing on TV. At first, I?m mainly worried I?m going to mispronounce Mnuchin. Then a thought occurs: How do I know that Mnuchin actually said what I?m claiming he said? And who cares if he did? He doesn?t control the money supply. He has no obvious power to do anything to the dollar, except to print however many of them the Federal Reserve thinks should exist.A voice comes over the loudspeaker to say Sanders is running late. The journalists around me moan and groan. They?re used to this. This press briefing, like many Trump press briefings, has a hard stop, and Sanders often runs late. The general suspicion is that she?s trying to keep the briefing as brief as possible.In here you are even more at the mercy of the president?s impulses than the rest of the country. The vast majority of the time nothing much happens. But because you never know what and when Trump will tweet, or insist at a moment?s notice that the media come and observe him doing something, you have to stick around all hours of the day. ?They never tell us ?You?re actually safe to leave? at the end of the day because they don?t know what Trump is going to do,? says one of my new colleagues. ?If you look in and all of them are gone and the schedule says it?s the end of the day, then we make the call, and go home.? It?s been this way from the start. ?It really was like the pirates had taken over the ship and had no idea where things were,? says a prominent TV correspondent. ?You?d see people wandering around lost. The disarray was intense. They hadn?t read the Obama manual for how to do things.?On the one hand, the demand for news from this place just keeps growing, and the people inside the press room feel more important than ever. Even the guy from the free paper in nearby Montgomery County, Maryland -- the sort of thing you find just inside the front door of Chinese restaurants -- has a deal with CNN. On the other hand, theWhite Housejournalists? sense of well-being, never great, seems to be in decline. Several confess to me that they aren?t sleeping well, have put on weight, have mental health issues, etc. They?re becoming a bit more like Trump.And put a foot even slightly wrong in theWhite Housepress pool and the president of the United States might very well identify you as an enemy of the republic. Consider Zeke Miller, the excellent 20-something correspondent for the Associated Press. At the start of the Trump administration, then employed by Time magazine, he?d been let into the Oval Office and noticed the bust ofMartin Luther Kingwasn?t where it had been when Obama was in office. Miller dashed off a report saying that the bust had been removed -- then learned, 20 minutes later, that the bust had simply been moved, to a spot behind the open door where he couldn?t see it. He apologized instantly and profusely for his mistake, and corrected it. Nevertheless, Trump, standing in front of a memorial for those who had died serving in the CIA, blasted him by name as an example of journalistic mendacity. Sean Spicer, then the press secretary, accepted Miller?s abject apology and then marched out to the lectern and humiliated him all over again.I shift in my chair, worrying over my question. Who cares what theWhite Housethinks about the dollar? A hundred or more journalists, three-quarters of them staring at their phones, are now waiting for Sanders.This question of mine is not a good question. Even I don?t want to hear what the answer is.Do I really want to be seen asking a stupid question? A person needs to be careful in here. I decide I?m not going to ask a question of interest only to idiot currency speculators. I?m going to ask a question that interests me.A voice comes on the loudspeaker to say that Sanders is running even later. ?Jesus Christ,? says a voice behind me.I can ask the TrumpWhite Housea single question: What will it be? Several pops to mind, in no particular order. Has Trump ever explicitly asked for someone to show him how the nuclear football works? After the New York banks cut him off, in 1990, did Trump accept money, even indirectly, from Russians? If Obama hadn?t made fun of Trump at thatWhite HouseCorrespondents? Association dinner, would he have run for president? Can you name a book that Trump has read, or even pretended to have read? Have you ever heard him speak of art, or music, or dance, or poetry? Is it true, as I?ve been told by reliable sources, that soon after taking office Trump asked aWhite Housephotographer to Photoshop a picture of his inauguration to make the crowds look bigger?Sanders enters the press room, finally. Trump?s response to the Spicer debacle was to make sure that his press secretaries had hair and makeup. Never mind what he?s saying; fix how he looks! Sanders indeed looks great: pale pink lipstick, black dress, pearl necklace and a silver bracelet that looks as if it is digging penitently into her left wrist. She smiles, but as if to prove that she can. She reads a statement. When she?s done about 100 hands go up.The questions are not like my questions. They address only what?s happened in the last few hours: Trump?s attempt to intimidate FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, the latest twist on the Russia investigation, another school shooting, a rumor that the first official state dinner will be with France. To me, it seems that the interesting questions are not the questions of the moment, but the questions of the moment are the only questions that would not sound completely bizarre in this place. The point of the exercise for Sanders seems to be to pretend to interact honestly with the press without actually doing so -- and also, where she can, to torture the journalists.It?s a good sign for the country that Zeke Miller soldiers on, in the seat just in front of me. At the start of the news conference he raised his hand, and was called upon. ?Secretary Mnuchin made some news over there earlier today when he said that he was pleased to see that there's a weaker dollar,? he says. ?Does that reflect accurately the president?s view of U. S. currency??TheWhite Housepress room had emptied when, after 8 p.m., the New York Times breaks the news: Trump tried to fire special counsel Robert Mueller, and was prevented from doing so whenWhite Housecounsel Don McGahn threatened to quit. Trump calls it fake news, but it is confirmed by other papers and several sources. Who are these sources? From whom did this news come? Who in a position to know such things has an interest in sharing it with the world? Everyone at once notices that Steve Bannon and McGahn have hired the same lawyer to defend them in the Mueller investigation.I sit down with a formerWhite Housepress secretary to rewatch the briefing. To my eyes almost nothing of real interest had occurred. I wondered what the thing looked like to eyes better trained. ?The briefing?s not a perfect mechanism,? he says. ?But it?s actually not bad for accountability. Because you are on display. And everyone can see if you have a bad answer.? Yet he has found the Trump briefings odd, and unlike any he?s ever witnessed. ?Like every other administration, we were making an argument about what was good for the country. She?s protecting a fragile ego.?He pulls up the tape. ?The hardest questions in the briefing room are the shortest,? he says. ?There is an inverse correlation between the length of the question and the difficulty of answering it.? The first thing he notes is the length of the tape: just over 21 minutes. ?Mine averaged more than an hour,? he says. He actually admires the way Sanders eats up what little clock there is, with a long opening statement. He notes that she is different from Spicer. ?She?s better prepared. She?s spent some time thinking about what kinds of questions she was going to get. Spicer was just winging it.? He watches for a bit, until a reporter asks if it is true that Trump asked McCabe whom he voted for and Sanders replies that she has no way of knowing, as she wasn?t in the room. ?I know he didn?t ask me!? she says, brightly.He stops the tape. In this moment he sees something much bigger -- a subplot in the Trump presidency. The people meant to speak for Trump either do not have, or do not want, real access to him. The McCabe story is on the front page of major newspapers. There is no chance that someone isn?t going to ask a question about it. ?The press secretary is supposed to go to the president and say ?What did you say to Andrew McCabe??? he says. ?It definitely erodes her credibility with the press when she says, ?I dunno, I wasn?t in the room.? And the fact that she is willing to prepare makes you wonder why she hasn?t.?More to the point, he thinks, there is every chance that Sanders will be swept up in the Russia probe. ?And in that case there?s benefit to her saying, ?I haven?t talked to the president.?? Expect a lot more of her not talking to the president, he thinks.It?s 8 p.m., but Trump is returning fromDavosand a crowd is gathering at theWhite Houseto view him. After a bit the 40 or so journalists get summoned to a bleak courtyard outside the building, and are instructed to wait there. It is 37 degrees, and dark, and we all huddle together. After maybe 10 minutes we are escorted by staff to a stretch of asphalt behind the White House, beneath the Andrew Jackson magnolia tree they said they were cutting down but for some reason have not. There we wait some more. Two expensively dressed young women appear with a less expensively dressed maleWhite Housestaffer, who is apparently showing them around the place. ?This is the South Lawn,? he says in the darkness. ?And that is the residence.? They giggle and take out their phones. A rat sprints from the Andrew Jackson magnolia into a bush.Three choppers finally approach. Someone explains that they always have two decoys. The idea is that if an assassin managed to shoot one down there is only a 1 in 3 chance that Trump would be inside. It?s three-card monte.In the end only the middle chopper lands on the South Lawn. The wind from its blades knocks everyone back a step. No toupee is safe. Trump waits a few minutes, until the propellers are completely still, then walks out, salutes a Marine and marches with great seriousness to theWhite Houseback door. There he pauses, for a brief moment, and turns toward the press. This moment is why 40 journalists have spent more than an hour standing in the cold. ?Davoswas really, really great,? Trump says. ?Our country?s doing great. A lot of money is coming into our country. We have many, many people fromDavosbringing that money over here. I think it was a very successful trip.? He sounds just like he tweets.With that he walks inside, followed by his communications director, Hope Hicks. I try and fail to imagine anyone inDavossaying to Trump ?I want to bring my money to your country.?Steve Bannon lives in a brick town house on Capitol Hill, a stone?s throw from the Supreme Court. To discourage people from approaching his front door he?s strung a thin rope across the steps. A second door, hidden behind the steps, opens before I even get to it. A trim young man in a neat suit steps out. ?I?m Bigz,? he says.Bigz leads me into a waiting room. It?s sunny outside, but the blinds are drawn tight and the place is gloomy. One wall is decorated with a painting of Hillary Clinton taking cash from some African warlord, another with a poster of a snarling honey badger, the Breitbart News mascot. The tables are stacked, almost like a bookstore, with multiple copies of polemical works mostly aimed at the Clintons. Michael Wolff?s ?Fire and Fury,? in which Bannon is quoted as saying that it was treasonous for Trump?s children to have met with the Russians, is nowhere to be seen. Bigz asks me to wait here, beside a pile of anti-Clinton books, while Bannon wraps up a meeting. ?You can read a book if you want,? he suggests, gently.I talk to Bigz instead. Bigz hails from Uganda. A few years ago he ran for Ugandan political office, and was beaten and jailed. When he learned that the Ugandan regime planned to kill him, he sought, and was granted, political asylum in the US In Washington, he set out to make a living tending people?s gardens. He?d knocked on Bannon?s door, and Bannon had hired him to clean up the small patches of green in front of his house. Apparently, Bannon liked him so much that he brought him inside to -- well, what Bigz does remains unclear to me. The garden?s dead.After a bit, Bigz leads me back outside and up the steps, past the thin rope and into the part of the house in which Bannon lives. Bigz makes coffee while I poke around the vast assortment of materials strewn across the old grandma furniture: papers piled on side tables, papers piled on sofas, framed magazine covers lying on the floor, books everywhere. Joshua Green?s ?Devil?s Bargain,? which told the story of how Steve Bannon gotDonald Trumpelected president, is propped on the mantel. The house feels less inhabited than borrowed -- as if, say, a chapter of some Southern fraternity had booted a blue-haired Washington matron out of her Capitol Hill town house and proceeded to trash the place. At the moment the brothers appear to be cramming to raise their grades, so the school doesn?t shut them down before the next kegger.Bigz arrives with coffee. ?What exactly is your job?? I ask. He just smiles as Bannon booms, from some other room, ?Dude, he does it all!?In walks Bannon. He looks as if he?s just pulled an all-nighter, or as if he?s trying to trick people into thinking he?s a drunk. (He doesn?t touch alcohol.) If you walked past him lying on a bench in a derelict Greyhound bus station, you wouldn?t give him a second glance. Now Bannon cannot go out without being recognized and hounded. ?I?m on a constant loop out there as the fucking devil,? he says, as he sits down at his dining room table. ?I can?t go out. I have not walked into a bookstore since Aug. 15, 2016.? He shrugs. ?You?re either going to do this or you?re not.? A lot of people love him and a lot of people hate him, and I get the sense that he regards all of them as troubling, though perhaps not equally so. He?s installed surveillance cameras and bulletproof windows in his home, and hired former Navy SEALs to guard it.Before I raise the reason I?d come to see him, he talks for a bit. The 2008 financial crisis was a turning point in his political life, he says. His working-class father had retired after 50 years at the phone company. ?The market is crashing and Jim Cramer came on TV and said if you need cash in the next 10 years blow out your stocks. My dad called me up and said I just sold all my AT&T. He just gave it away. By the next spring I was radicalized.? Bannon saw the financial crisis as the most dramatic illustration of a problem at the core of American life: the betrayal of society by the elites. It?s not the elites whose children die in the pointless wars they start."", 'It?s not the elites who lose their jobs when U. S. companies move their plants overseas. And it?s not the elites who suffered the consequences of the financial crisis. ?This thing didn?t just come all of a sudden,? he says, referring to the crisis. ?How did it happen? Who is responsible? We still don?t know the answer to that question.?']",/article/international/looking-for-donald-in-all-wrong-places-new-aspects-of-trump-character-118021100103_1.html

She used to consult him frequently on political matters.He was as frank with her in January 28, 1980, as he had been at a meeting at her house on June 28, 1975, two days afterthe Emergencyhad been declared. That frankness had not gone down well, and by July 3 he had been sent back to his cadre, Madhya Pradesh.In 1980 he had just this to say. ?You stopped listening in 1974 and when you did listen, you listened to the wrong people.?Who were the wrong people she asked. The Intelligence Bureau, said the officer. She nodded and after some brief chit chat ended the meeting.They never met again. He was relieved of his post and not given another posting for 18 months when he retired.Happens to allMrs Gandhi was not the first, and will not be the last,prime ministerwho stopped listening or listened to the wrong people. The global list ? led byRichard Nixon? is depressingly long.Indeed, her own father had fallen victim to this problem which led to war with, and walloping by, China in 1962. The same thing, of listening to the wrong people, happened to his grandson Rajiv after the disastrous summer of 1987.By 1995, P VNarasimha Raohad also cut himself off and listening only to yogis and self-seeking officers. Vajpayee was something of an exception but he too had his favourites.Manmohan Singhdoesn?t count asprime ministerin any real sense of the word.Modi?s turnNow it is Narendra Modi?s turn. And as the Gujarat and Rajasthan results show, it is becoming abundantly clear that he is listening to the wrong people.He is also making the mistake that Mrs Gandhi made during 1975-77: of annoying everyone at the same time.', 'Farmers, middle class, rich people, Muslims, Dalits, even his own rank and file ? you name the group ? and it is upset with him.']",/article/politics/modi-is-making-the-mistakes-indira-made-in-1975-77-of-upsetting-everyone-118021100144_1.html
